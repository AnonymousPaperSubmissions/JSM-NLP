    "name": "Janet B. Parks",
    "affiliated_institution": "Bowling Green State University",
    "year": "1992",
    "title": "Scholarship: The Other ‘Bottom Line' in Sport Management",
    "demographics": {
      "details": "The text indicates the scholar is Janet B. Parks. While age and ethnicity are not explicitly stated, delivering the Zeigler Lecture in 1992 suggests an established, likely mid-to-late career academic. Her focus on gender issues and self-reference ('myself included') when discussing academics interested in the behavioral dimension affecting women suggests she identifies as female.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her position as an established scholar, likely female, in 1992, shapes her subjective interpretation of sport management's needs, particularly regarding social equity and the 'other bottom line.' This influences her meaning-making process, drawing attention to overlooked aspects of the field. Her reflexivity is shown by positioning herself within the academic discourse she analyzes."
    },
    "research_area": {
      "focus": "Behavioral dimensions of sport, social issues in sport (gender, race, ethics, violence, homophobia - implied), the nature and application of scholarship in sport management, and the theory-practice relationship.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her focus on the 'behavioral domain' and social issues necessitates understanding socio-cultural contexts and subjective meanings, aligning with interpretivist principles. She interprets social phenomena within sport rather than seeking universal laws, highlighting subjective meaning-making and contextual understanding."
    },
    "field_stage_view": {
      "assessment": "Early to developing. Parks states sport management has 'chosen not to walk down that well-worn calf path. Instead, we have made a path of our own,' indicating a field actively forging its identity and distinguishing itself.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This assessment reveals her contextual understanding of sport management's historical trajectory as a relatively new academic field. Her call for a 'new path' is a reflexive comment on the field's past and its potential future, shaped by its unique developmental context."
    },
    "target_audience": {
      "description": "Primarily fellow sport management academics (faculty, researchers), students in sport management, and implicitly, practitioners in the sport industry who may be influenced by academia or hire its graduates.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her address to academics using scholarly frameworks (e.g., Boyer), coupled with a strong emphasis on student impact and practical application, shows reflexive positioning. She understands her role as a scholar shaping both academic discourse and future professional practice, thereby constructing meaning across different contexts."

  "content_themes": [
    {
      "topic": "The 'Calf Path' Metaphor",
      "underlying_meaning": "A critique of uncritical adherence to tradition and a call for sport management to forge its own intentional, ethically-informed path, rather than blindly following established but potentially flawed precedents.",
      "meaning_production": "Through an extended allegorical poem and its direct application to sport management, Parks constructs a powerful narrative contrasting mindless conformity with critical innovation and responsibility.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This reflects Parks's subjective meaning-making. She uses the metaphor to interpret the field's challenges and to persuade the audience to adopt a specific (critical and proactive) perspective on its development."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Critique of the Theory vs. Practice Dichotomy",
      "underlying_meaning": "The perceived separation between academic theory and practical application in sport management is a false or unhelpful dichotomy; they are, or should be, mutually informative and symbiotic.",
      "meaning_production": "Parks argues this by citing scholars who emphasize application, noting the theoretical basis of JSM articles, and refuting the existence of distinct 'camps.' She frames the relationship as inherently integrated.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Parks subjectively reinterprets the existing discourse within the field, challenging a potentially dominant narrative of division. Her meaning-making seeks to construct a more integrated understanding based on her interpretation of evidence and scholarly ideals."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Boyer's Four Styles of Scholarship",
      "underlying_meaning": "Advocates for a broader, more inclusive definition of scholarship (discovery, integration, teaching, application) to legitimize diverse academic contributions and effectively bridge the theory-practice gap in sport management.",
      "meaning_production": "By introducing and applying Boyer's established framework to sport management, particularly its behavioral domain, she provides a conceptual tool for re-evaluating scholarly priorities.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her selective adoption and re-contextualization of Boyer's framework is an act of subjective meaning-making, interpreting its relevance and utility for sport management's specific context and challenges."
    },
    {
      "topic": "The Behavioral Domain and Social Issues in Sport (The 'Other Bottom Line')",
      "underlying_meaning": "Critical social issues like sexism, racism, violence, and discrimination are rampant in sport and constitute an 'other bottom line' that sport management scholarship and practice must urgently address.",
      "meaning_production": "Through a stark list of ten contemporary examples of problematic behaviors and attitudes within sport, she highlights the severity and breadth of these issues, demanding they be seen as central concerns.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her selection and framing of these issues demonstrate subjective meaning-making, as she interprets these phenomena as critical to the field's responsibility. This theme heavily relies on contextual understanding of sport as a social institution reflecting societal problems."
    },
    {
      "topic": "The Role of Students and Education",
      "underlying_meaning": "Sport management students are crucial agents of future change. Education must therefore equip them with theoretical understanding, critical thinking skills, and an appreciation for social issues to improve the sport environment.",
      "meaning_production": "Parks explicitly positions students as 'greatest beneficiaries' and future 'change agents,' connecting the scholarship of teaching directly to societal impact and the improvement of sport.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This reflects her reflexivity regarding the purpose and impact of academic work. She constructs a meaning where scholarship finds its ultimate value in its transformative potential, actualized through educating future professionals. This is based on her interpretation of the educational context and its possibilities."

        "interpretivist_significance": "This explicitly signals that her analysis stems from her subjective interpretation and lived experience within the academic field, rather than claiming detached objectivity. It foregrounds her personal role in meaning-making."

        "pattern": "Emphasis on interpretation and understanding meaning",
        "example": "\"...the scholarship of integration asks, ‘What do the findings mean? Is it possible to interpret what's been discovered in ways that provide a larger, more comprehensive understanding?’\"",
        "interpretivist_significance": "This directly aligns with the core interpretivist concern for how meaning is constructed, understood, and applied, moving beyond mere data collection to deeper comprehension within a specific context."

        "pattern": "Inclusive language ('we', 'our')",

        "interpretivist_significance": "This metaphor powerfully constructs meaning by framing uncritical adherence to tradition as negative and urging a more conscious, self-determined direction for sport management. It shapes the audience's interpretation of the field's challenges and potential."

        "device": "Antanagoge",

        "interpretivist_significance": "By acknowledging a counter-argument and then refuting or recontextualizing it, Parks demonstrates reflexive engagement with differing viewpoints. This device allows her to acknowledge complexity while reinforcing her interpretation of the theory-practice relationship."

        "device": "Appeal to Authority (Ethos)",
        "example": "\"In his well-respected book, Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate, Boyer (1990) provided a perspective...\"",
        "interpretivist_significance": "Citing respected external (Boyer) and internal (Zeigler, Boucher) authorities lends credibility to her arguments. This also demonstrates contextual understanding by situating her work within existing scholarly discourse, thereby co-constructing meaning with established voices."

  "overall_interpretivist_assessment": "Janet B. Parks conceptualizes sport management as a developing field needing to define its purpose beyond mere financial success. Her lecture strongly embodies interpretivist principles: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making** is evident in her use of the 'Calf Path' metaphor, her reframing of the theory-practice debate, her selection and interpretation of Boyer's framework, and her insistence on an 'other bottom line' focused on social issues. She actively constructs meaning and urges the audience to adopt her interpretations. 2) **Contextual Understanding** is paramount as she situates sport management within its historical development, its relationship to broader societal problems (sexism, racism), and its interdisciplinary academic context. The behavioral issues she highlights are understood as deeply embedded in specific social and cultural contexts. 3) **Reflexivity** is demonstrated through her positioning of herself and the academic community as agents responsible for shaping the field's future. She reflects on the role and impact of scholarship, particularly teaching, in fostering change. Her critique is an invitation for the field to reflect on its own practices and choose a more 'enlightened path.'",
