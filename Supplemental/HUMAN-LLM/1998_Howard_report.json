    "year": "1998",
    "title": "The Changing Fanscape for Big-League Sports: Implications for Sport Managers",
    "demographics": {
      "details": "Based on attending a game in 1957 as a 'young boy' and his comment 'Oh my, am I that old?', if he was approximately 10 in 1957, he would be around 51 in 1998, placing him in a mid-to-late career stage. He advised 21 Ph.D. students over 'the past 15 or 20 years,' indicating a significant academic tenure. Ethnicity is not explicitly stated.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His age and career stage provide a long-term perspective, enabling historical contextualization of sport industry issues (contextual understanding). Self-deprecating humor and acknowledgements of his career suggest reflexivity about his position and experience. Mention of his wife as a 'sounding board and editor' indicates how personal relationships shape his subjective meaning-making and scholarly output."
    },
    "research_area": {
      "focus": "Sport economics and finance, particularly concerning professional sports leagues, facility financing, fan behavior, and affordability. He states choosing 'a topic I've spent a lot of time thinking and writing about: the current reality of professional sports in North America.'",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His deep engagement with this area shapes his interpretation of the field's problems and potential solutions. His focus on the economic 'reality' reflects his subjective meaning-making, highlighting issues he deems critical based on his synthesis of historical data and economic analyses."
    },
    "field_stage_view": {
      "assessment": "Views 'big league' sports as late mature/early decline ('Golden Era is over,' 'maturity-decline side of the slope'). Sees 'minor league' and emerging women's leagues as early/growth stages ('thriving,' 'poised to explode'). His overall view of sport management is nuanced: mature in core segments, nascent/growing in others.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This nuanced perspective reflects a sophisticated contextual understanding, interpreting different segments based on unique trajectories. His use of the Product Life Cycle is a framework for this subjective meaning-making, allowing him to categorize and interpret various parts of the industry."

    "target_audience": {
      "description": "Primarily fellow sport management academics ('those of us charged with... preparing the next generation'), current/future sport management students ('our students'), and NASSM members. Potentially industry practitioners.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His inclusive language ('we,' 'us') and focus on educational implications demonstrate reflexivity about his role within the NASSM community. He positions himself as a guide aiming to influence future practitioners and scholars, tailoring his message to this specific academic context."

    {
      "topic": "Economic Decline of 'Big League' Sports",
      "underlying_meaning": "The traditional professional sport model is unsustainable due to uncontrolled costs (especially salaries) and alienated fans. The 'Golden Era' is a nostalgic past, not the current reality.",
      "meaning_production": "Howard constructs this through historical comparisons (1957 vs. 1997), statistical data (profit margins, debt), expert quotes (Granik, Reinsdorf), and case examples (49ers, Indians).",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Reflects Howard's subjective meaning-making, synthesizing diverse data into a narrative of decline. His selection and emphasis of certain facts reveal his interpretation of what is most significant in the economic landscape."

      "topic": "The Alienated Fan and Changing Fanscape",

      "meaning_production": "Uses personal anecdotes (father's reaction), cost indices (FCI), demographic data (attendee incomes), quotes (Angell, Pollin), and reports to illustrate the shift and its consequences ('gentrification').",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Howard's interpretation of 'fandom' and the value of the 'traditional bedrock consumer' is a subjective meaning-making process. His concern for affordability reflects a particular value system applied to sport, framing the issue through a socio-economic lens."

      "topic": "The Rise of 'Minor League' and Niche Sports",
      "underlying_meaning": "Opportunity and growth in sport management lie significantly in emerging and secondary leagues offering a more affordable, 'fan-friendly' experience, reminiscent of an earlier era.",
      "meaning_production": "Developed using the Product Life Cycle model, growth statistics for minor/women's leagues, contrasting their accessibility with major leagues, and linking to his personal nostalgia.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Demonstrates Howard's subjective meaning-making by constructing a 'counter-narrative' to major league decline. His optimism is shaped by personal values (fan-friendliness, affordability) and his interpretation of market trends."

      "interpretivist_significance": "Highlights Howard's reflexivity. He positions himself and colleagues as influential actors responsible for shaping the field's future, with the lecture itself being an attempt to influence this meaning-making process."

Howard conceptualizes sport management through a deeply interpretivist lens, weaving together subjective meaning-making (e.g., 'Golden Era is over,' valuing 'authentic' fan experiences), contextual understanding (historical comparisons, socio-economic shifts, PLC model), and reflexivity (positioning himself as an educator, fan, and long-standing academic). He constructs a narrative of major league sports facing economic and existential crises due to internal financial structures and alienation of traditional fans, while simultaneously identifying growth and opportunity in more accessible minor league and niche sports. His analysis is shaped by personal history, scholarly expertise in economics, and a clear sense of responsibility towards his academic audience and the future of the field. He sees sport management not as fixed entities but as a dynamic interplay of forces, values, and decisions, open to interpretation and change.",
