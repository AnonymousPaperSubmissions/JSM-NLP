    "affiliated_institution": "The Ohio State University",
    "year": "2002",
    "title": "A Different Lens to View Mentoring in Sport Management",
    "demographics": {
      "details": "Female. As a Zeigler Award recipient in 2002, she is an established scholar, likely in her middle career stage given her discussion of Kram's career stages (e.g., advancement, middle career). Ethnicity is not stated.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "As a female scholar in 2002, her focus on mentoring, peer relationships, mutual support, and collaborative advancement could reflect her subjective meaning-making shaped by experiences within academia. This perspective may highlight the importance of relational aspects in professional development, possibly influenced by navigating a field where gender dynamics could play a role. Her reflexivity is shown in using her platform to advocate for structures supporting others based on these potentially gendered experiences."
    },
    "research_area": {
      "focus": "Mentoring in sport management, with a specific emphasis on advocating for Kathy E. Kram's model of peer relationships as an alternative or supplement to traditional, hierarchical mentoring. Focuses on professional development, support systems, and community building within sport management academia.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her choice to focus on interpersonal dynamics and support systems (mentoring, peer relationships) reflects a subjective understanding that academic success and field development are socially constructed. This aligns with interpretivism by emphasizing how individuals make meaning of their careers and the field through these relationships. It also shows contextual understanding of the specific needs within sport management for such support."
    },
    "field_stage_view": {
      "assessment": "Developing/Early-to-Mature. She states, 'In order to keep our field moving forward, we must contemplate other areas as well,' and refers to previous Zeigler lectures that 'challenged us and helped us to define and improve our field.' This implies a field that has made progress but still requires active effort to mature, define itself, and improve its internal support structures.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her perception of sport management as a field still needing improvement and definition reflects a contextual understanding of its ongoing evolution. Her proposals for new mentoring approaches reveal her reflexivity – positioning herself as an agent of change who interprets the field's current context as ripe for new ways of understanding and fostering professional growth."
    },
    "target_audience": {
      "description": "Primarily sport management educators, professionals within the North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM), and graduate students in the field. She explicitly addresses 'us as professionals' and makes recommendations for 'NASSM professionals and student members.'",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her direct address to 'us as professionals' and tailored recommendations for NASSM clearly demonstrate reflexivity. She is not an external observer but an active participant speaking to her own community. This shapes her discourse to resonate with their shared context and experiences, aiming to collaboratively construct new meanings and practices for professional development within sport management."

        "topic": "Critique and Expansion of Traditional Mentoring",
        "underlying_meaning": "While traditional mentoring is valuable, it has limitations (e.g., availability, hierarchy) and may not fully address the diverse needs of professionals at various career stages within sport management.",
        "meaning_production": "By reviewing literature on mentoring definitions, functions, and benefits, then implicitly contrasting it with the advantages of peer relationships (mutuality, availability, duration). She acknowledges mentoring's importance before pivoting to 'a different lens.'",
        "interpretivist_significance": "This reflects her subjective meaning-making process where she interprets existing knowledge on mentoring and identifies a gap or an area for reinterpretation. It shows contextual understanding by acknowledging established practices before proposing an evolution."
      },
      {
        "topic": "Advocacy for Peer Relationships (Kram's Model)",
        "underlying_meaning": "Peer relationships (information, collegial, special) offer a more mutual, accessible, and potentially enduring form of support that can fulfill many career and psychosocial functions critical for professional development in sport management.",
        "meaning_production": "Through detailed exposition of Kram's (1988) framework, including types of peer relationships, their functions, application across career stages (establishment, advancement, middle, late), and advantages like 'mutuality.'",
        "interpretivist_significance": "This is the core of her subjective meaning-making, where she interprets and champions Kram's theory as a 'different lens' particularly suited to the sport management context. She constructs peer relationships as a vital, perhaps underutilized, mechanism for professional growth and support."
      },
      {
        "topic": "Actionable Recommendations for NASSM and Individuals",
        "underlying_meaning": "The sport management field, particularly through its organization NASSM, should proactively foster both improved traditional mentoring (especially for graduate students) and robust peer relationships to enhance the profession and support its members.",
        "meaning_production": "By proposing concrete initiatives: mentor-protégé contracts, independent study courses for protégés, a NASSM clearinghouse for peer relationships, a formalized NASSM mentoring program for graduate students, and a new 'Best Practices in Mentoring and Teaching' section in the Journal of Sport Management.",
        "interpretivist_significance": "Demonstrates strong reflexivity; she positions herself as an advocate for tangible change within her professional community. These proposals are rooted in her contextual understanding of NASSM's role and the needs of sport management academics, aiming to institutionalize supportive, meaning-making interactions."
      },
      {
        "topic": "Situating Mentoring within the Legacy of Sport Management Scholarship",
        "underlying_meaning": "Her call to focus on mentoring, and specifically peer relationships, builds upon a tradition of critical self-reflection and leadership within the field, as exemplified by previous Zeigler lecturers and Dr. Zeigler himself.",
        "meaning_production": "By referencing past Zeigler lecturers (Slack, Pitts, Weese, Olafson), citing Dr. Zeigler's work and personal mentoring attributes (via Chelladurai), she frames her contribution as part of an ongoing dialogue aimed at advancing the field.",
        "interpretivist_significance": "This shows deep contextual understanding, linking her argument to the historical and intellectual lineage of the Zeigler Award. Her interpretation of these past contributions provides a foundation for her own subjective focus, reflecting a reflexive positioning of her work within this respected tradition."

        "device": "Antanagoge",
        "example": "'There are some disadvantages to peer relationships... Regardless of these negatives, the benefits of peer relationships outweigh the negatives.'",

Pastore conceptualizes sport management as an evolving academic field whose progress and the well-being of its members are deeply intertwined with the quality of interpersonal relationships and support systems. Her lecture is a strong example of interpretivist scholarship because she centers her analysis on (1) Subjective Meaning-Making, by proposing 'a different lens' to reinterpret mentoring through Kram's peer relationship model and by drawing on her own convictions; (2) Contextual Understanding, by situating her arguments firmly within the specific historical and contemporary context of sport management academia, NASSM, and its members' lived experiences (e.g., career stages, professional pressures); and (3) Reflexivity, by explicitly positioning herself as an advocate within her professional community, using her platform to propose changes that aim to reshape shared understandings and practices regarding professional support and development. She argues that the field co-constructs its meaning and future through these vital interpersonal connections.",
