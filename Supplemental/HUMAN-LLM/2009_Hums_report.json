    "name": "Mary A. Hums",
    "affiliated_institution": "University of Louisville",
    "year": "2009",
    "title": "The Conscience and Commerce of Sport Management: One Teacher’s Perspective",
    "demographics": {
      "details": "Experienced academic; started teaching 30 years prior to 2009 (circa 1979). By 2009, likely a senior scholar (mentions being an Associate Professor 10 years prior). Self-describes her current relation to students as mother-like. Ethnicity not explicitly stated, assumed to be White/European-American based on name and general context of US academia at the time, though this is an inference.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her extensive career provides a rich, longitudinal dataset of lived experiences that deeply informs her subjective meaning-making regarding the evolution of sport management. Her self-positioning as a 'mother figure' reflects a specific relational framing (reflexivity) and how she interprets her role and influence. The long duration highlights how her interpretations have been shaped by evolving contexts (contextual understanding)."
    },
    "research_area": {
      "focus": "Ethical issues in sport management, social responsibility, sport for development and peace, sport and human rights, disability sport. This is evidenced by her cited 1999 article on ethics, her discussion of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the thematic focus of the lecture itself.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her research focus on the 'conscience' aspects of sport reveals a subjective meaning-making process that prioritizes social justice, ethical conduct, and the societal impact of sport, rather than purely commercial or performance-oriented interpretations. This focus inherently requires understanding phenomena within their specific social and human contexts (contextual understanding)."
    },
    "field_stage_view": {
      "assessment": "Mature but evolving and facing new complexities. She contrasts the sport industry of '30 years ago' with 'today,' noting it's 'in a shape not seen before' and students 'walk in a completely different world.' While acknowledging foundational figures like O’Malley and Mason, her focus is on contemporary, often global, issues that challenge existing paradigms.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her assessment reflects a contextual understanding shaped by her personal trajectory within the field. She interprets sport management not as static, but as a dynamic entity constantly being re-shaped and re-interpreted in response to new global, technological, and social contexts. This view underscores the interpretivist idea that meaning is not fixed but emergent."
    },
    "target_audience": {
      "description": "Primarily sport management educators and researchers, as explicitly stated ('how does that relate to us as sport management educators and researchers?'). Secondarily, sport management students, as the lecture discusses curricular content for them. The immediate audience is Zeigler Award lecture attendees.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her address to educators reveals a reflexive understanding of her role, and theirs, in shaping the future meanings, values, and practices of sport management. By targeting educators, she aims to influence the interpretive frameworks passed on to the next generation, demonstrating an awareness of the social construction of the field (reflexivity and contextual understanding)."

      "topic": "Good Citizenship in Sport Management",

      "meaning_production": "Through the central metaphor of 'Temple (spirit/conscience) vs. Agora (marketplace/commerce),' personal anecdotes illustrating her evolving teaching focus, and framing new issues (social entrepreneurship, human rights) as essential for 'good citizens.'",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This theme highlights Hums' subjective meaning-making, constructing an interpretation of sport management that prioritizes ethical and social values. It challenges purely functionalist or economic views of the field."

      "interpretivist_significance": "Her narrative constructs a meaning of sport management as a dynamic, context-dependent field. This underscores the interpretivist principle of contextual understanding, where meaning evolves with changing societal and global landscapes."

      "interpretivist_significance": "This demonstrates reflexivity, as Hums positions herself and her colleagues as active agents in shaping the values and interpretive lenses of future sport managers, thereby co-constructing the future meaning of the field."

      "interpretivist_significance": "This emphasizes the broadened social and global context (contextual understanding) crucial for interpreting contemporary sport management. It also reflects her subjective commitment (subjective meaning-making) to these values as integral to the field's purpose."

Her lecture is a narrative of subjective meaning-making, evident in her personal journey marking the evolution of her teaching and understanding, and her critical emphasis on the 'conscience' of sport. Her understanding is profoundly shaped by contextual understanding – historical (tracing her career over 30 years and referencing the field's foundations), social (addressing emergent global issues like human rights, environmentalism, and sport for development), and disciplinary (situating her work within and as a call to sport management educators). Reflexivity is central, as she explicitly positions herself as 'one teacher,' reflects on her changing role relative to students, acknowledges her collaborations, and underscores her responsibility (and that of her colleagues) in shaping the field's values and future practitioners. She constructs sport management not as a static set of positivistic principles but as a dynamic interplay between 'commerce' and 'conscience,' constantly being reinterpreted in light of new global realities and ethical imperatives. Her call to embed these broader issues into curricula is an appeal for a more holistic, critically reflective, and ethically engaged interpretation of the field itself, highlighting the social construction of its meaning and purpose.",
