    "name": "Jeffrey D. James",
    "affiliated_institution": "Florida State University",
    "year": "2017",
    "title": "Not All Doctoral Programs Are Created Equally",
    "demographics": {
      "details": "The text states a qualification for the award is 'Must have a minimum of ten years of service as a teacher, supervisor, administrator, or combination of the above.' This implies Dr. James is at least mid-career, likely more senior given the prestige of the Zeigler Award. No explicit age or ethnicity is provided.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His career stage, presumably experienced, shapes his subjective meaning-making by providing a long-term perspective on doctoral education trends and challenges. This lived experience forms a key part of his contextual understanding of the field's development."
    },
    "research_area": {
      "focus": "His contributions are grouped into: (1) Psychological Continuum Model, (2) Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption, and (3) mentoring of doctoral students. The lecture focuses on the third area, specifically doctoral training.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His scholarly identity, particularly his work in mentoring doctoral students, directly informs his subjective interpretation of the importance of doctoral program quality. This specific research focus provides a lens through which he constructs the meaning of 'preparation' for future scholars, reflecting his contextual embeddedness in doctoral education."
    },
    "field_stage_view": {
      "assessment": "He acknowledges the field 'matures and grows' but questions if it's 'really making many changes or improving' in response to repeated 'calls' for advancement. This suggests a field that is established ('mature') but potentially struggling with effective evolution or responsiveness ('early' in terms of addressing certain deep-seated issues like philosophical training).",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This view reveals his contextual understanding of sport management's history of self-critique and a reflexive stance on the gap between recognizing issues and implementing effective, widespread solutions. His questioning reflects a subjective interpretation of the field's developmental trajectory."
    },
    "target_audience": {
      "description": "NASSM members, particularly faculty involved in doctoral training programs, administrators, and by extension, current and future doctoral students. He directly addresses 'those who are part of doctoral training programs' and the 'association' (NASSM).",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His choice of audience indicates his reflexive positioning as an influential voice seeking to shape the practices and standards within his academic community. He is constructing meaning for and with those who have agency over doctoral education."
    }
  },
  "content_themes": [
    {
      "topic": "Variability in Doctoral Program Requirements",
      "underlying_meaning": "Significant differences in credit hour requirements (total, coursework, dissertation, research methods) across North American Sport Management doctoral programs suggest an inequitable and inconsistent preparation of future scholars.",
      "meaning_production": "Meaning is produced through a quantitative review of NASSM-listed doctoral programs, presenting data on credit hour ranges and averages, and contrasting the potential educational experiences of students in programs at different ends of the spectrum.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Dr. James subjectively interprets these numerical variations not merely as data but as indicators of a fundamental problem in the quality and consistency of scholarly preparation, thereby constructing a particular meaning of 'inequality' in doctoral education."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Insufficient Emphasis on Philosophy of Science/Inquiry",
      "underlying_meaning": "The prevalent lack of required courses in philosophy of science/inquiry means doctoral students are often trained in research 'tools' without a deep understanding of underlying paradigms, epistemologies, or the 'why' behind their research choices, hindering critical scholarship.",
      "meaning_production": "This meaning is constructed by highlighting his own program's inclusion of such courses, his survey finding only 4 of 26 programs requiring them, and arguing for the importance of understanding ontological, epistemological, and axiological positions.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His subjective meaning-making process prioritizes philosophical grounding as essential for robust scholarship. He interprets the absence of such courses as a critical deficit in the field's approach to doctoral training."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Call to Action for Program Improvement and Critical Reflection",
      "underlying_meaning": "The responsibility lies with faculty within individual programs and with NASSM as an association to critically evaluate and enhance doctoral training, specifically by integrating philosophical inquiry to produce well-rounded, critical scholars rather than mere 'tool users'.",
      "meaning_production": "Meaning is produced through direct exhortations: 'evaluate one’s program,' 'determine whether students... are being challenged to understand philosophy,' and suggesting NASSM should consider expectations for doctoral training.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This demonstrates his reflexivity, as he positions himself and his colleagues as agents of change. He urges a collective contextual understanding that the quality of future scholars depends on current actions, a meaning he constructs through his analysis."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Nature of Sport Management as a Diverse Field",
      "underlying_meaning": "The breadth of Sport Management (marketing, legal, social media, sport for development, etc.) demands scholars with versatile critical thinking skills and a broad understanding, not just narrow, tool-based training.",
      "meaning_production": "He lists multiple sub-fields and diverse research areas within Sport Management to illustrate its multifaceted nature.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "His subjective meaning-making links the field's contextual diversity directly to the pedagogical need for philosophically grounded and critically adept scholars, rather than those with only technical research skills."

        "interpretivist_significance": "These contrasts are used to construct and emphasize the perceived problem, shaping the audience's understanding of the disparities and their implications. This is a key mechanism in his subjective meaning-making about program quality."

        "device": "Direct Address and Call to Action",

His **subjective meaning-making** is evident in his interpretation of quantitative program data as symptomatic of deeper qualitative issues in pedagogical philosophy. He constructs a narrative where the 'how-to' of research has overshadowed the crucial 'why,' a meaning derived from his own values regarding rigorous scholarship. His **contextual understanding** is rooted in his decades of academic experience, his specific work at Florida State, his review of NASSM's institutional practices, and his engagement with previous Zeigler lectures, all of which inform his assessment of the field's current state and historical patterns. **Reflexivity** permeates his lecture: he interrogates his own selection for the award, uses his institutional experience as a case study, and explicitly positions himself and his peers as responsible agents for change. His call for challenging students to 'be more than we are' is a profound reflexive statement on the continuous, intergenerational project of advancing sport management as a thoughtful and impactful field of study.",
