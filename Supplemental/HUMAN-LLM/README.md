It is deeply embedded ('hiding in plain sight') and normalized within sport culture.                                                                                                                                                   | Through direct definitions, contrasts with sexism in other industries (e.g., 'Mad Men episode feel'), citing examples of overt sexism, and referencing scholarly work on dominant discourses and institutionalized norms.                                                                                                                                                                     | This reflects Fink's subjective meaning-making, where she interprets sport as a unique context where sexism manifests differently. She constructs this meaning by drawing on shared cultural references and academic frameworks, highlighting how certain behaviors become 'taken for granted'.                                                                                     |

This subjective interpretation emphasizes the lived experiences of those affected and the systemic nature of the harm, moving beyond abstract critique.                                                                                                               |

This involves adopting alternative frames (like Shaw and Frisby's) to critique and transform taken-for-granted practices.                                                                                                                     | By referencing previous calls to action (Cunningham), advocating for Shaw and Frisby's alternative approach, suggesting applications in research and teaching, and providing examples of positive momentum (e.g., 'Like a Girl' campaign).                                                                                                                                                    | This theme showcases Fink's reflexivity – she positions herself and her audience as agents of change. Her call for 'undoing gender' and working with sport organizations reflects a contextual understanding that meanings are not fixed and can be re-negotiated through collective, situated action.                                                                              |

Current evaluation systems are often misaligned with these broader goals.                                                                                         | McGarry constructs this meaning by contrasting traditional views with a 'pluralistic' definition from the Academy of Management report, citing past Zeigler winners' calls for practical relevance (Parks, Weese), highlighting scholar-activists (Evanovich, Cooper, Burton), and critiquing evaluation systems that incentivize 'wrong behaviors.'                                          | This reflects McGarry's subjective meaning-making process, where she actively reinterprets 'impact' through a critical, values-laden lens. She challenges the dominant, often positivist, understanding by foregrounding qualitative, societal, and ethical dimensions, aligning with interpretivist emphasis on context-specific and value-driven knowledge.                       |

These issues must be explicitly named and confronted.                                                           | She uses statistics on NASSM demographics, NASSM climate survey results, personal anecdotes (her own, Donna Pastore's), cites scholars discussing sexism (Fink) and racism (Singer, Armstrong, DuBois, DiAngelo), and points to the underrepresentation of Black scholars as evidence of these systemic issues.                                                                               | McGarry's subjective meaning-making is informed by critical theories (feminism, critical race theory). She constructs a narrative that challenges the 'taken-for-granted' assumptions of the field, revealing how power relations and social identities shape experiences and opportunities, a core tenet of interpretivist inquiry into social realities.                          |

Meaning is not just interpreted but enacted. Her call emphasizes that shared understanding and collective action can reshape the field's context and values.                                             |

Her interpretation of athlete migration as 'deskilling' or 'poaching' is a subjective framing that highlights power imbalances and questions the fairness of these global flows, rather than viewing them simply as free market talent exchange.                       |

Acknowledging this inherent duality is essential for responsible sport management.                                                                                                                                   | Through the titular metaphor and by juxtaposing personal, positive experiences of sport with an extensive list of negative aspects (corruption, exploitation, discrimination, etc.), Frisby constructs sport as a site of conflict and power struggles, not just benign entertainment or business.                                                                                            | Frisby's interpretation challenges a potentially naive or overly optimistic view of sport. Her subjective meaning-making here aims to shift the audience's perception to see sport as a microcosm of broader societal issues, requiring critical scrutiny.                                                                                                                          |

Sport management needs to embrace multiple paradigms, including CSS, to achieve a comprehensive understanding.                                                                                                       | Frisby explicitly discusses positivism, interpretivism, criticalism, and postmodernism, outlining their differing epistemological and ontological assumptions. She argues, 'My goal here is not to fuel the ‘paradigm wars’... Rather, I am offering critical social science as a paradigm, not the paradigm.'                                                                                | This directly reflects a core tenet of interpretivism: the acknowledgment that knowledge is constructed through specific lenses. Frisby's subjective meaning-making champions intellectual diversity and critiques paradigmatic insularity.                                                                                                                                         |

Her subjective interpretation is that current approaches are insufficient and that CSS offers a path toward more ethical and impactful engagement with sport.                                                                                                                       |

This framing is a deliberate act of meaning-making, providing the central pillar upon which his subsequent arguments about strategy are built.                                                                                                                                     |

Complex problems inherently require diverse perspectives and shared effort ('it takes a village'). This collaborative spirit enriches both personal and professional life.                                                                                             | Through the titular metaphor, explicit connection to personal philosophy ('resonates with my personal and work life.

This includes catering to diverse populations (women, disabled, seniors, mass participation) beyond an exclusive focus on elite sport.               | By citing warnings and advice from other scholars (Brassie, Stier, Porter, Chelladurai, Zeigler, Clement) and advocating for programs that are 'current and innovative' and align with 'demographic fit and the needs of our field.'                                                                                                                                                          | Weese subjectively interprets the advice of peers and market signals to construct a strategic vision for the field.

A rebalancing is needed to prevent 'selling our collective souls'.                                                          | Boucher juxtaposes quotes favoring a business approach with critical perspectives (e.g., Whitson & MacIntosh). He uses examples like O'Malley's beer sponsorship talk and terms like 'sportism' to highlight the perceived imbalance. Rhetorical questions ('Is it right for a sport manager only to be a conduit...?') prompt critical reflection.                                           | This reflects Boucher's subjective meaning-making. He interprets the rise of commercialism not as a neutral development but as a problematic shift with significant moral and philosophical implications for the field's identity. He constructs a narrative of a field potentially losing its way.                                                                                 |

Current approaches to bridge this are insufficient; he proposes research become more practical (e.g., 'appreciative inquiry') and curriculum more theoretical, particularly concerning ethical and social issues.  | He outlines criticisms from both academics and practitioners, citing scholars who advocate for theoretical rigor versus practical application. He uses the analogy of 'studying a truck at rest' to illustrate the limitations of current academic approaches to understanding practice. He proposes specific shifts in research focus (e.g., 'appreciative inquiry') and curriculum content. | Boucher subjectively diagnoses the problem and offers solutions based on his interpretation of the distinct realities and meaning-systems of academics and practitioners. His embrace of 'appreciative inquiry' signals an openness to research paradigms that prioritize understanding context and fostering positive, co-constructed change, aligning with interpretivist values. |

Sound decision-making solves problems.'), cites management theorists (Simon, Vroom), and uses high-profile examples of faulty decision-making (Bay of Pigs, Challenger, Ben Johnson scandal) to underscore its critical importance and consequences. He lists specific decision-making concepts for study. | This is Boucher's primary act of subjective meaning construction. He elevates 'decision-making' as the key interpretive framework for understanding and improving sport management, based on his values, experiences, and reading of organizational challenges. He aims to create a shared meaning or 'focal point' for a field he perceives as fragmented.                         |

She uses metaphors of a journey ('research journey,' 'turning points,' 'road trip') and storytelling, citing Isabelle Allende on memory.                                                                         | This is a prime example of subjective meaning-making. Taks actively constructs a coherent and meaningful narrative from her 40-year career, interpreting past events and interactions through her chosen framework.

Early methods were often insufficient or misleading.                                                                                                                | She details her shift from standard Economic Impact Analysis to Cost-Benefit Analysis, from tangible to intangible impacts (social, well-being), and methodological refinements like differentiating 'other-referenced' vs. 'self-referenced' social impact items after critical feedback. She highlights the ambiguity and challenges in measurement.                                        | Her evolving approach demonstrates how subjective interpretations of research findings (e.g., limited economic benefits, overrated social impacts) and contextual interactions (e.g., discussions with Bob Heere on 'wording matters') lead to a re-construction of meaning and methodology. This reflects a deep contextual understanding of research practice.                    |

| Janet S. Fink        | University of Massachusetts Amherst                                                        |   2015 | Hiding in Plain Sight: The Embedded Nature of Sexism in Sport                                                                    | Janet S. Fink conceptualizes sport management as a field deeply enmeshed in, and reflective of, broader societal power structures, particularly concerning gender. Her analysis is profoundly interpretivist: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making**: She leverages her personal experiences and passion for sport ('reluctant critic') to interpret sexism not as an objective fact but as a lived, felt phenomenon 'hiding in plain sight,' whose meaning is constructed through social interaction and often normalized. 2) **Contextual Understanding**: She meticulously details how sexism in sport is historically and socially situated, often more overt ('Mad Men episode feel') than in other industries, and perpetuated by 'taken-for-granted' organizational practices and discourses. She recognizes sport as a powerful, ubiquitous platform with a unique cultural fabric. 3) **Reflexivity**: Fink explicitly positions herself within the NASSM community, acknowledging her own perspective and calling on her peers to recognize their collective agency in 'undoing gender.' She is aware of her audience and the 'risky' nature of her topic, adapting her language to engage them. Her call to adopt alternative frames (Shaw & Frisby) is a call to re-negotiate shared meanings and practices within the field. Fink ultimately portrays sport management not as a field governed by immutable laws, but as a dynamic social world where meanings are contested and where critical, reflexive scholarship can contribute to transformative change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| David K. Stotlar     | University of Northern Colorado                                                            |   1999 | Vertical Integration in Sport                                                                                                    | David K. Stotlar conceptualizes sport management, specifically the phenomenon of vertical integration, primarily through an economic and strategic business lens. His subjective meaning-making is evident in the selection and interpretation of corporate actions (Disney, News Corp., Time-Warner) as exemplars of vertical integration, and in his engagement with varying theoretical perspectives (Mintzberg, Harrigan) to frame the discussion. Contextual understanding is demonstrated by situating these corporate strategies within the specific techno-economic environment of the late 1990s (rise of media conglomerates, internet emergence, regulatory climate) and the particularities of the sport industry (content dependency, league structures). Reflexivity is subtly present in his choice to frame the issue for an academic audience, his acknowledgment of debates and alternative nomenclatures ('divisionalized corporation'), and the concluding open-ended question about the 'madness,' which positions him not as a detached observer but as an interpreter grappling with the implications of these powerful trends. He constructs understanding by weaving together theory, corporate narratives, regulatory actions, and potential impacts, presenting a multi-layered interpretation of vertical integration's significance in sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| P.

Chelladurai conceptualizes sport management as a dynamically evolving field, rich with opportunity but fraught with 'growing pains.' His analysis is deeply rooted in interpretivist principles: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making** is evident in his use of personal anecdotes (the 'scum gutter'), his interpretations of inter- and intra-field tensions (e.g., 'patronizing attitudes,' 'holier-than-thou' stances), and his personal framing of the field's challenges and aspirations. 2) **Contextual Understanding** permeates his lecture, as he consistently situates sport management within the broader academic landscape (its relationship with 'mother disciplines,' allied fields, and more established areas like sport sociology), its historical development, and its societal relevance. He sees the field's identity and challenges as shaped by these contexts. 3) **Reflexivity** is central, as he explicitly positions himself as a senior member of the NASSM community ('all of you and I'), acknowledges the influence of his mentor (Zeigler), and directly addresses his peers to collectively shape the field's future. He is not an objective observer but an active participant in constructing the meaning and trajectory of sport management, using the lecture as a platform to influence that construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

McGarry  | University of Connecticut                                                                  |   2019 | Enact, Discard, Transform: An Impact Agenda                                                                                      | Jennifer McGarry conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, socially constructed field where meaning, particularly around 'scholarly impact,' is contested and shaped by power relations, historical context, and diverse subjectivities. She employs a critical interpretivist framework, asserting that knowledge is not value-neutral but deeply influenced by one's standpoint and positionality (subjective meaning-making). Her analysis of NASSM and the broader field emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific social, historical, and cultural contexts that produce inequities and narrow definitions of success (contextual understanding). Throughout the lecture, McGarry is highly reflexive, acknowledging her own 'vantage point,' critiquing dominant norms from that perspective, and calling on her peers to also engage in self-reflection and transformative action. She sees the Zeigler address itself as an opportunity to construct and negotiate new meanings, urging the field to 'Enact, Discard, Transform' outdated paradigms in favor of a more inclusive, just, and genuinely impactful future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Mahony conceptualizes sport management as a socially constructed, dynamic field whose future depends on the collective meaning-making and concerted actions of its members. His lecture is deeply rooted in subjective meaning-making, interpreting challenges like faculty shortages and research gaps through his extensive personal and administrative experiences. He demonstrates a strong contextual understanding by consistently situating sport management's issues within broader academic, institutional, and inter-organizational power structures. Mahony's reflexivity is evident as he positions himself as both a product and advocate of collaboration, critically examines the field's internal practices, and reflects on his own scholarly journey. The central 'symphony' metaphor powerfully conveys his interpretivist vision: sport management's 'merit' and progress are not objective states but are achieved through ongoing, collaborative 'performance,' requiring dialogue, shared understanding, and unified effort to navigate its complex context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

His **subjective meaning-making** is evident in his interpretation of quantitative program data as symptomatic of deeper qualitative issues in pedagogical philosophy. He constructs a narrative where the 'how-to' of research has overshadowed the crucial 'why,' a meaning derived from his own values regarding rigorous scholarship. His **contextual understanding** is rooted in his decades of academic experience, his specific work at Florida State, his review of NASSM's institutional practices, and his engagement with previous Zeigler lectures, all of which inform his assessment of the field's current state and historical patterns. **Reflexivity** permeates his lecture: he interrogates his own selection for the award, uses his institutional experience as a case study, and explicitly positions himself and his peers as responsible agents for change. His call for challenging students to 'be more than we are' is a profound reflexive statement on the continuous, intergenerational project of advancing sport management as a thoughtful and impactful field of study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

His analysis is deeply rooted in contextual understanding, meticulously tracing the field's historical trajectory from its origins within physical education, pinpointing critical junctures like the 1960s 'Great Debate' and the subsequent theoretical turn, and acknowledging the profound influence of key figures, most notably Earle F. Zeigler. Paton engages in subjective meaning-making by interpreting trends in research (e.g., the shift towards theory, persistent descriptive methodologies), evaluating their significance (e.g., 'progress,' 'serious indictment'), and thereby constructing a compelling narrative of the field's development, its achievements, and its ongoing challenges. Reflexivity is evident as he positions himself as a scholar contributing to this very discourse; he is not a detached observer but an active participant who critiques the past, assesses the present, and advocates for specific future directions. He consciously aims to shape the field's self-perception and its research agenda, urging for an approach that marries theoretical rigor with practical applicability. His work itself is an exemplar of interpretivist scholarship—an engaged, historically informed, and critical interpretation of how a field makes sense of itself and strives for intellectual maturity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

His subjective meaning-making is evident in the 'heart and soul' metaphor for competition and his impassioned argument for elevating strategy research from its 'sparse' state. He demonstrates a strong contextual understanding by tracing the historical development of strategy literature, analyzing the inter-organizational dynamics of academic bodies (NASSM, SMAANZ, etc.) through the concept of 'co-opetition,' and arguing that the field's uniqueness is best revealed through contextual application of theory. Reflexively, Shilbury positions himself as an engaged scholar whose international perspective (Australian involved in North American academia) and leadership experiences inform his critique. He constructs sport management not as a static entity but as an evolving discourse, where the meanings of its core concepts and its overall identity are actively shaped by the scholarly community's choices and interpretations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Her analysis is deeply interpretivist, emphasizing subjective meaning-making through her interpretation of student behaviors (e.g., 'mooks,' 'midriffs'), the significance she attributes to program approval as a marker of quality, and her impassioned valuation of teaching and service. Contextual understanding is paramount, as she frames the field's journey historically and situates its challenges within broader societal shifts like student consumerism and generational value differences. Reflexivity is evident as she speaks from within the NASSM community (using 'we,' 'our'), acknowledging her role in shaping its discourse and explicitly aiming to persuade her peers towards her constructed vision of a 'meritorious' field. Her lecture is not a detached observation but an engaged, value-laden interpretation aimed at fostering a shared understanding and collective action to navigate the complexities of achieving and maintaining academic excellence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Her lecture embodies interpretivism through: 1. **Subjective Meaning-Making**: She actively constructs 'multiculturalism' as an ethical imperative, interprets data on discrimination through a critical lens, and infuses her analysis with personal conviction ('my belief,' 'my hope'). 2. **Contextual Understanding**: Her arguments are deeply embedded in the socio-historical context of the early 1990s, referencing contemporary issues (Title IX, 'politically correct' debates), demographic shifts (Workforce 2000), and the intellectual lineage of sport philosophy (Zeigler). She analyzes sport organizations as products of their cultural environments. 3. **Reflexivity**: DeSensi is highly reflexive, explicitly acknowledging how personal factors ('gender, race, ethnic heritage') shape biases and perspectives for everyone, including herself. She positions her lecture as an intervention intended to provoke 'social action,' demonstrating awareness of her role and potential impact as a scholar in shaping the field's consciousness and future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This argument is deeply rooted in her subjective meaning-making, particularly her 'village' philosophy which equates collaborative, integrated effort with enriched understanding and personal/professional fulfillment. Her analysis demonstrates a strong contextual understanding of sport management's history, its current disciplinary 'silos,' the complexities of real-world problems, and broader academic trends. Reflexivity is central to her lecture, as she consciously positions herself as an experienced scholar using the prestigious platform to advocate for a paradigm shift, aiming to influence the collective interpretation of research excellence and practice within her field. She constructs interdisciplinarity not merely as a methodology, but as a more profound, relational, and ultimately more meaningful way of knowing and addressing the multifaceted phenomena within sport management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Her lecture is a profound exercise in interpretivism. She champions subjective meaning-making by centering personal values, authenticity, and individual passion ('study things that are important to us'), using her own career narrative as the primary vehicle for conveying insights. Her contextual understanding is evident as her interpretations (e.g., of work-life balance) are shown to be deeply embedded in and evolving through her long-term immersion in NASSM, familial roles, mentor-mentee relationships, and international experiences. Highly reflexive, Dixon acknowledges her own positionality, vulnerabilities, and the influence of others, positioning herself as a fellow traveler sharing subjectively derived wisdom. Her entire address constructs and shares meaning through storytelling and metaphor, urging her audience to find their own authentic paths within the shared academic context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Her lecture is a narrative of subjective meaning-making, evident in her personal journey marking the evolution of her teaching and understanding, and her critical emphasis on the 'conscience' of sport. Her understanding is profoundly shaped by contextual understanding – historical (tracing her career over 30 years and referencing the field's foundations), social (addressing emergent global issues like human rights, environmentalism, and sport for development), and disciplinary (situating her work within and as a call to sport management educators). Reflexivity is central, as she explicitly positions herself as 'one teacher,' reflects on her changing role relative to students, acknowledges her collaborations, and underscores her responsibility (and that of her colleagues) in shaping the field's values and future practitioners. She constructs sport management not as a static set of positivistic principles but as a dynamic interplay between 'commerce' and 'conscience,' constantly being reinterpreted in light of new global realities and ethical imperatives. Her call to embed these broader issues into curricula is an appeal for a more holistic, critically reflective, and ethically engaged interpretation of the field itself, highlighting the social construction of its meaning and purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Pastore conceptualizes sport management as an evolving academic field whose progress and the well-being of its members are deeply intertwined with the quality of interpersonal relationships and support systems. Her lecture is a strong example of interpretivist scholarship because she centers her analysis on (1) Subjective Meaning-Making, by proposing 'a different lens' to reinterpret mentoring through Kram's peer relationship model and by drawing on her own convictions; (2) Contextual Understanding, by situating her arguments firmly within the specific historical and contemporary context of sport management academia, NASSM, and its members' lived experiences (e.g., career stages, professional pressures); and (3) Reflexivity, by explicitly positioning herself as an advocate within her professional community, using her platform to propose changes that aim to reshape shared understandings and practices regarding professional support and development. She argues that the field co-constructs its meaning and future through these vital interpersonal connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

His lecture is a profound exercise in interpretivist scholarship. He engages in **subjective meaning-making** by passionately arguing for a particular vision of the field—one grounded in tangible, context-specific research that bridges theory and practice, using the Dual Process Theory as a framework to articulate this vision. His analysis is rich in **contextual understanding**, as he situates his arguments within the historical development of sport management, the ongoing dialogue initiated by previous Zeigler lecturers, and the pressing institutional challenges faced by academic programs, particularly in research universities. Furthermore, Zhang exhibits significant **reflexivity**, explicitly positioning himself, his research, and his cultural background ('as an Asian') within the narrative. He acknowledges the limitations of his perspective ('ideas are subject to debate'), his personal experiences with grant funding, and his indebtedness to mentors, all while consciously aiming to 'reenergize the discussions' and shape the future of the discipline. His call for 'conscious thought' in defining 'what to study' is itself an interpretivist act of constructing meaning and advocating for a self-aware, contextually sensitive approach to knowledge creation in sport management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

His analysis is deeply interpretivist: 1) Subjective Meaning-Making: He actively constructs meanings for key terms like 'sport industry' (broad, commercial) versus the field's traditional focus ('locker room'), using personal conviction ('I want to argue,' 'I believe') to drive his narrative. 2) Contextual Understanding: His arguments are embedded in a rich understanding of multiple contexts – the historical trajectory of sport management, the dynamic evolution of the global sport industry, the academic landscape of mainstream management, and the socio-cultural perception of sport as 'big business.' He posits that the field's primary challenge is its failure to adapt its interpretative frameworks to these evolving contexts. 3) Reflexivity: Slack is overtly reflexive, acknowledging his own standpoint ('my own position as an organizational theorist') and leveraging his Zeigler Award platform to actively shape the discourse and direction of the field he is analyzing. He critiques its outputs (JSM) and institutions (NASSM) from an insider's perspective, aiming to inspire a collective re-interpretation of the field's purpose and potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Through extensive reflexivity, she deconstructs her own scholarly evolution, highlighting how subjective understandings are shaped by, and in turn reshape, disciplinary contexts. She champions a continuous process of learning, questioning, and re-interpretation, urging the field to embrace the messiness and situatedness of qualitative inquiry. Her lecture is an embodiment of interpretivism, demonstrating how knowledge is constructed, contested, and contextually understood through individual and collective reflective practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Pitts conceptualizes sport management as a socially constructed field of study, actively shaped by the interpretations, practices, and reflexivity (or lack thereof) of its scholarly community. She emphasizes subjective meaning-making by repeatedly calling for critical examination of definitions, assumptions ('box thinking'), and the scope of inquiry, arguing that the field's identity is not inherent but built through collective discourse and action. Her analysis is deeply rooted in contextual understanding, referencing the field's historical development (NASSM's age, origins of programs), its relationship with other disciplines, and the specific socio-temporal moment of 'the millennium.' Pitts demonstrates reflexivity by explicitly stating the origins of her own perspective, positioning herself within the academic community she addresses ('we,' 'us'), and urging that community to become more aware of how its collective choices in research, teaching, and professional organization shape the field's reality and credibility. Her lecture is a call for more conscious, critical, and expansive meaning-making to define sport management's future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Funk conceptualizes sport management scholarship as a dynamic social ecosystem where the creation and dissemination of knowledge ('idea diffusion') is a fundamentally human, often 'uncomfortably slow,' and context-dependent process. His analysis is deeply rooted in subjective meaning-making, where he interprets statistical data (citations, editorial board demographics) and personal experiences (his career path, development of the PCM, co-author network) through the theoretical lens of diffusion. He demonstrates strong contextual understanding by situating his arguments within historical debates in sport management (e.g., theory development) and the practical realities of academic publishing. Reflexivity is a cornerstone of his lecture, as he consistently positions himself as an experienced scholar using his own journey as a case study and a source of wisdom to mentor 'new and emerging scholars.' He doesn't claim to offer absolute truths but rather 'insight' and strategies derived from his interpreted reality, emphasizing the agency scholars have in navigating and shaping this ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

James Weese conceptualizes sport management as a rapidly maturing academic field whose very success has engendered significant challenges, primarily concerning the recruitment and retention of qualified faculty. His analysis is deeply informed by subjective meaning-making, evident in his central 'Opportunities and Headaches' dichotomy, the integration of personal experiences and values (e.g., the importance of face-to-face teaching), and explicitly stated opinions. He demonstrates profound contextual understanding by intricately linking the internal dynamics of sport management academia to broader socio-demographic trends (e.g., 'population push'), the historical evolution of the field, and the operational realities of university systems. Reflexivity is apparent as Weese positions himself within the scholarly community, acknowledges the influence of his mentors, and consciously tailors his discourse to the varied perspectives of his audience (graduate students, administrators). He constructs a narrative wherein the future quality and sustainability of sport management education are contingent upon the professoriate, urging strategic, ethical, and contextually aware action from all stakeholders. His worldview is that of an experienced, concerned insider, using his platform to interpret current realities and advocate for the field's responsible stewardship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Zeigler conceptualizes sport management (and its antecedents) as a field whose meaning and trajectory are actively constructed through the interplay of historical context, institutional forces, and the subjective experiences and ethical choices of its professionals. His lecture is an act of interpretivist scholarship itself: he reflexively uses his own storied career as a primary text to interpret the field's past struggles for identity and legitimacy (contextual understanding), to make subjective sense of its current 'uncertain future,' and to advocate for a 'positive meliorism'—a shared framework for meaning-making and purposeful action. He emphasizes that understanding 'why' (the motivations, the values, the historical underpinnings) is paramount for navigating 'what' to do next, championing a process of continuous, conscious interpretation and re-interpretation by NASSM and its members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

His analysis is deeply informed by interpretivist principles:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

He critically assesses the field's dominant research paradigms and metaphors ('machines or organisms'), reflects on his own academic lineage under Zeigler, and consciously positions himself as an agent of change, urging his colleagues and future scholars toward 'a new direction' and 'more enlightened path.' His lecture itself is an act of shaping the collective understanding and future trajectory of sport management scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Parks conceptualizes sport management as a developing field needing to define its purpose beyond mere financial success. Her lecture strongly embodies interpretivist principles: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making** is evident in her use of the 'Calf Path' metaphor, her reframing of the theory-practice debate, her selection and interpretation of Boyer's framework, and her insistence on an 'other bottom line' focused on social issues. She actively constructs meaning and urges the audience to adopt her interpretations. 2) **Contextual Understanding** is paramount as she situates sport management within its historical development, its relationship to broader societal problems (sexism, racism), and its interdisciplinary academic context. The behavioral issues she highlights are understood as deeply embedded in specific social and cultural contexts. 3) **Reflexivity** is demonstrated through her positioning of herself and the academic community as agents responsible for shaping the field's future. She reflects on the role and impact of scholarship, particularly teaching, in fostering change. Her critique is an invitation for the field to reflect on its own practices and choose a more 'enlightened path.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Her analysis is deeply rooted in interpretivist principles. She emphasizes subjective meaning-making by exploring how individuals (academics, students, practitioners) and the collective (NASSM) interpret and navigate their roles, challenges (like work-life balance, balancing academic mandates), and the very identity of the field. Her call to reframe tensions as productive and to prefer dialogue over discussion underscores a belief in the power of interpretation and collaborative inquiry to foster growth. Contextual understanding is central, as she situates sport management within its historical development (Zeigler's legacy, NASSM's growth), its institutional setting (university mandates), its interdisciplinary connections, and its relationship to broader societal issues, arguing for relevance and engagement. Reflexivity is evident throughout as she positions herself within the discourse ('I believe,' personal anecdotes), acknowledges her influences, and invites her audience (fellow NASSM members) into a shared process of critical self-examination and future-shaping for the field. Her lecture itself is an act of interpretivist inquiry, seeking to uncover and shape understandings of sport management through dialogue and reflection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

His analysis is deeply interpretivist:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

He dissects how 'legitimations,' 'fallacies,' and 'narratives' about sport are socially constructed meanings that require critical interpretation. His call for a 'sport-focused' agenda is itself an attempt to guide the collective meaning-making process towards a 'distinctive' understanding of the discipline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

He emphasizes understanding sport phenomena (e.g., health outcomes, socialization) not in isolation, but in relation to their specific implementation contexts and broader societal/economic sectors. The socio-historical context of 'popular wisdom' is also critical to his argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Chalip positions himself and his fellow scholars ('we,' 'us') as active agents in defining the field. He urges introspection about the field's purpose, its relationship with 'home disciplines' and practitioners, and the impact of its research. By questioning current practices and calling for new research directions, he encourages the field to critically examine its own assumptions and its role in both perpetuating and challenging existing meanings of sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Mason      | Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada |   2024 | The Bare Supervening Necessities of Theory Development in Sport Management                                                       | Daniel S. Mason conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, socially constructed field where the development and diffusion of theory are profoundly shaped by subjective meaning-making processes, rich contextual influences (disciplinary, social, historical), and the critical reflexivity of its scholars. He portrays theory not as a set of objective truths but as tools interpreted and wielded by individuals within a community, subject to social 'necessities' that accelerate adoption and 'brakes' (including systemic inequities and gatekeeping) that suppress radical potential. His lecture is an exemplar of interpretivist inquiry itself, using personal narrative, analogy, and critical reflection to construct a nuanced understanding of the field's past, present, and potential future, ultimately advocating for a more inclusive and critically aware scholarly practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Howard     | University of Oregon                                                                       |   1998 | The Changing Fanscape for Big-League Sports: Implications for Sport Managers                                                     | Dennis R. Howard conceptualizes sport management through a deeply interpretivist lens, weaving together subjective meaning-making (e.g., 'Golden Era is over,' valuing 'authentic' fan experiences), contextual understanding (historical comparisons, socio-economic shifts, PLC model), and reflexivity (positioning himself as an educator, fan, and long-standing academic). He constructs a narrative of major league sports facing economic and existential crises due to internal financial structures and alienation of traditional fans, while simultaneously identifying growth and opportunity in more accessible minor league and niche sports. His analysis is shaped by personal history, scholarly expertise in economics, and a clear sense of responsibility towards his academic audience and the future of the field. He sees sport management not as fixed entities but as a dynamic interplay of forces, values, and decisions, open to interpretation and change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Marijke Taks         | University of Ottawa (current), University of Windsor (previous), KU Leuven (Alma Mater)   |   2023 | “What Have I Learned : : : ” and How Did I Get There? Reflection on a Research Journey                                           | Marijke Taks conceptualizes sport management scholarship as a deeply personal, evolving, and contextually embedded journey of meaning-making. Her lecture is a powerful demonstration of interpretivism, framing knowledge not as a collection of objective, immutable truths, but as a dynamic tapestry woven from subjective experiences ('I'), significant social interactions ('influencers'), and critical responses to contextual 'triggers.' Her subjective meaning-making is evident in the overarching narrative structure she imposes on her 40-year career, particularly her framework of 'triggers, influencers, and lessons learned.' Contextual understanding is central, as pivotal moments like her transatlantic move, specific conference encounters, or engagement with differing research methodologies (e.g., 'wording matters') profoundly reshape her research questions, interpretations, and perspectives on the field's priorities. Reflexivity permeates her entire account: she continuously positions herself within her story, meticulously acknowledging the influence of others on her intellectual path and, reciprocally, articulating her intent to inspire and guide future scholars. Her research trajectory itself—moving from broad economic impacts to nuanced considerations of resident perspectives, social impacts, subjective well-being, and the complexities of leveraging—underscores a commitment to uncovering and validating subjective experiences within sport management phenomena. Ultimately, Taks portrays sport management scholarship as a field where progress is driven by relentless curiosity, robust collaboration, critical self-reflection on one's own assumptions and methods, and an ongoing, interpretive dialogue with the ever-evolving socio-economic, cultural, and academic environment. |

Cunningham | Texas A & M University                                                                     |   2013 | Interdependence, Mutuality, and Collective Action in Sport                                                                       | George B. Cunningham conceptualizes sport management as a social and ethical field with a profound responsibility for fostering inclusivity and justice. He employs interpretivist principles by emphasizing subjective meaning-making, urging academics to re-interpret their roles and the purpose of sport itself towards social good. His analysis is deeply rooted in contextual understanding, drawing connections between individual actions, broader social systems of inequality (historical and contemporary), and the specific academic context of sport management. He demonstrates high reflexivity by positioning himself as an engaged scholar, acknowledging his own learning journey, explicitly addressing his academic audience about their power and responsibility, and anticipating/refuting counter-narratives. For Cunningham, sport management is not a fixed set of practices but a dynamic field whose meaning and impact are continually constructed through the collective actions (or inactions) of its constituents, particularly those in academia. He argues for a conscious, collective re-construction of the field around the principles of interdependence, mutuality, and proactive social change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

His subjective meaning-making is profoundly shaped by his role as a Dean, leading him to prioritize external validation, data-driven accountability, and standardized quality assurance (like accreditation) as markers of a 'serious' and sustainable academic program. His contextual understanding is evident in his historical overview of the field, comparisons with other disciplines (e.g., business, nursing), and analysis of stakeholder expectations within the university ecosystem. Reflexively, Andrew positions himself as a concerned insider with an administrator's pragmatic gaze, using his personal journey and experiences to underscore his arguments. He constructs a narrative of a field with potential but hampered by internal inconsistencies ('weakest links') and a collective reluctance to embrace rigorous external validation, ultimately arguing that the field's future strength depends on a shared commitment to higher standards, primarily through accreditation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
