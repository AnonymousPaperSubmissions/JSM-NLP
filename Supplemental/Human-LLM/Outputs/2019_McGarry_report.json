    "year": "2019",
    "title": "Enact, Discard, Transform: An Impact Agenda",
    "demographics": {
      "details": "Female. Explicitly states she is the 14th woman Zeigler award winner. Age is implied as being of a certain seniority ('Wait, am I that old that I would be considered for the Zeigler?'). Ethnicity is not explicitly stated, but her discussion of 'White people control[ling] this institution' suggests a critical awareness of racial dynamics. Career stage is advanced: Zeigler Award recipient, Department Head at her university.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her identity as a woman in a 'male-dominated field' profoundly shapes her subjective meaning-making, particularly regarding 'impact,' diversity, and inclusion. She uses her lived experience and position to critique existing power structures. Her advanced career stage lends ethos to her reflexive critique of the field and its norms, allowing her to speak from a position of established credibility while advocating for change."
    },
    "research_area": {
      "focus": "Keywords include feminism, interorganizational relationships, leadership, organizational culture, race. The lecture content centers on redefining scholarly 'impact,' critical management studies, diversity and inclusion, sexism, and racism within sport management and NASSM.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her research focus, particularly its critical and feminist orientation, provides the subjective lens through which she interprets 'impact' and the state of the sport management field. This shapes her perspective by prioritizing social justice, equity, and the challenging of dominant paradigms over traditional, purely quantitative measures of scholarly achievement. Her understanding is constructed through engagement with critical theories."
    },
    "field_stage_view": {
      "assessment": "Mature but requiring significant transformation. McGarry acknowledges the history and established structures of NASSM and sport management (referencing past Zeigler addresses, founding figures) but argues that it is at a stage where critical self-reflection and transformation ('Enact, Discard, Transform') are necessary to address systemic inequities and evolve its understanding of 'impact.'",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her assessment reflects a contextual understanding of sport management's evolution. She doesn't see it as 'newborn' but as having developed norms and power structures that now need to be critically examined and changed. This view is shaped by her interpretation of historical trends and current socio-political awareness, indicating a field that is established yet in need of reflexive adaptation to contemporary challenges regarding diversity and social justice."
    },
    "target_audience": {
      "description": "The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) membership, including established scholars, junior faculty, students, and potentially practitioners aware of NASSM. She specifically addresses different segments: 'women who are here,' 'every other badass woman,' 'students and professionals new to NASSM,' 'those of us who’ve been around a while.'",
      "interpretivist_significance": "Her direct address to varied segments of the NASSM community shows reflexivity in her positioning as a speaker and leader. She acknowledges the diverse experiences and positions within the audience and tailors her call to action accordingly, aiming to influence their subjective understanding of their roles and potential for enacting change within their specific contexts."

  "content_themes": [
    {
      "topic": "Redefining Scholarly Impact Beyond Traditional Metrics",
      "underlying_meaning": "True scholarly impact transcends citation counts and journal rankings; it involves tangible positive influence on practice, policy, social justice, and fostering inclusivity. Current evaluation systems are often misaligned with these broader goals.",
      "meaning_production": "McGarry constructs this meaning by contrasting traditional views with a 'pluralistic' definition from the Academy of Management report, citing past Zeigler winners' calls for practical relevance (Parks, Weese), highlighting scholar-activists (Evanovich, Cooper, Burton), and critiquing evaluation systems that incentivize 'wrong behaviors.'",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This reflects McGarry's subjective meaning-making process, where she actively reinterprets 'impact' through a critical, values-laden lens. She challenges the dominant, often positivist, understanding by foregrounding qualitative, societal, and ethical dimensions, aligning with interpretivist emphasis on context-specific and value-driven knowledge."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Addressing Systemic Inequities: Sexism, Racism, and Exclusion in Sport Management",
      "underlying_meaning": "Sport management and its organizations (like NASSM) are not meritocratic or neutral; they are embedded with systemic biases (sexism, racism, in-groups/out-groups) that marginalize individuals and limit the field's potential. These issues must be explicitly named and confronted.",
      "meaning_production": "She uses statistics on NASSM demographics, NASSM climate survey results, personal anecdotes (her own, Donna Pastore's), cites scholars discussing sexism (Fink) and racism (Singer, Armstrong, DuBois, DiAngelo), and points to the underrepresentation of Black scholars as evidence of these systemic issues.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "McGarry's subjective meaning-making is informed by critical theories (feminism, critical race theory). She constructs a narrative that challenges the 'taken-for-granted' assumptions of the field, revealing how power relations and social identities shape experiences and opportunities, a core tenet of interpretivist inquiry into social realities."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Call to Action: Individual and Collective Responsibility for Transformation ('Enact, Discard, Transform')",
      "underlying_meaning": "Meaningful change in sport management requires both individual commitment (e.g., critical teaching, mentorship, advocacy) and collective institutional efforts (e.g., reforming NASSM policies, leadership, culture) to disrupt the status quo and create a more inclusive and impactful field.",
      "meaning_production": "She issues direct calls to action ('Amplify each other’s voices,' 'Enact, Discard, Transform'), provides concrete examples of individual actions (colleagues' work, her own teaching), suggests organizational changes for NASSM, and invokes inspirational figures (Wambach, Hill, Raisman) who embody transformative action.",
      "interpretivist_significance": "This theme highlights the reflexive aspect of interpretivism, where the scholar positions herself and the audience as active agents capable of constructing new realities. Meaning is not just interpreted but enacted. Her call emphasizes that shared understanding and collective action can reshape the field's context and values."

        "interpretivist_significance": "These statements explicitly acknowledge the subjective nature of knowledge and the influence of the researcher's positionality, a core tenet of interpretivism. It signals a move away from claims of objectivity towards a more situated understanding."
      },
      {
        "pattern": "Use of terms related to meaning-making",
        "example": "'making meaning of academic impact,' 'sensemaking of scholarly impact,' 'management as a social construction.'",
        "interpretivist_significance": "These phrases directly reflect an interpretivist worldview where social reality and concepts like 'impact' are understood as actively constructed through human interpretation and interaction, rather than being pre-existing objective facts."

        "interpretivist_significance": "This preference for qualitative methods and lived experiences underscores the interpretivist value placed on deep, contextual understanding and the subjective meanings individuals attribute to their experiences, as opposed to purely quantitative or detached observation."

        "interpretivist_significance": "Metaphors are used to construct vivid, shared meanings and to frame complex issues in relatable terms. 'Throwing bats' subjectively redefines protest and challenge within an academic context, shaping the audience's understanding of possible actions."

        "interpretivist_significance": "These devices actively engage the audience, fostering a sense of shared inquiry and responsibility. They encourage reflexivity among listeners, prompting them to consider their own positions and interpretations, thereby co-constructing meaning during the lecture."

        "interpretivist_significance": "By establishing her credibility and appealing to shared academic and ethical values, McGarry constructs a persuasive argument. This shows how meaning is negotiated and validated within a specific social and disciplinary context (NASSM)."
      },

        "device": "Pathos (appeal to emotion)",
        "example": "Sharing Donna Pastore's story of frustration and bat-throwing; acknowledging the women in the audience and their 'badassery'; invoking feelings of exclusion experienced by marginalized groups.",
        "interpretivist_significance": "Emotional appeals help to create a subjective resonance with the audience, making the issues discussed more personal and urgent. This aligns with interpretivism's acknowledgment that human experience is not purely rational but also deeply emotional, and that these emotions shape meaning and action."

        "interpretivist_significance": "This device frames critique constructively, guiding the audience's interpretation towards agency and potential for positive change rather than despair. It helps construct a hopeful meaning even when discussing difficult truths."

This relationship is one of constructive challenge.",
        "interpretivist_significance": "This highlights the contextual understanding of power dynamics within the field.

  "overall_interpretivist_assessment": "Jennifer McGarry conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, socially constructed field where meaning, particularly around 'scholarly impact,' is contested and shaped by power relations, historical context, and diverse subjectivities. She employs a critical interpretivist framework, asserting that knowledge is not value-neutral but deeply influenced by one's standpoint and positionality (subjective meaning-making). Her analysis of NASSM and the broader field emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific social, historical, and cultural contexts that produce inequities and narrow definitions of success (contextual understanding). Throughout the lecture, McGarry is highly reflexive, acknowledging her own 'vantage point,' critiquing dominant norms from that perspective, and calling on her peers to also engage in self-reflection and transformative action. She sees the Zeigler address itself as an opportunity to construct and negotiate new meanings, urging the field to 'Enact, Discard, Transform' outdated paradigms in favor of a more inclusive, just, and genuinely impactful future.",
