# Human-LLM augmented discourse analysis results

The `Output` folder contains the original LLM outputs derived from our human–LLM augmented discourse analysis. We organize the results in tabular form below to facilitate interpretability and comparison. The first four subsections corresponds to the analytical domains: scholar context, content themes, language patterns, and social relationships. Final two subsections provide an overall evaluative assessment along with areas requiring further human review and interpretive judgment.

Zeigler     | The University of Western Ontario                                                          |   1989 | Using the Rays From History's Shining Lantern As We Face an Uncertain Future                                                     | Male, soon to be 70 years of age at the time of lecture (late 60s/septuagenarian). Background in US and Canadian academia; dual US-Canadian citizen. Career stage: Late career, in his 'final year' of part-time teaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | His advanced age and extensive, bi-national career provide a rich experiential basis for his subjective interpretations of the field's evolution. His 'septuagenarian reminiscences' demonstrate reflexivity, as he positions his personal journey as a lens to understand broader contextual shifts in sport management and physical education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Sport and physical education philosophy and ethics; sport management theory and practice; history of physical education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | His focus on philosophy, ethics, and history aligns with interpretivism's concern for meaning, values, and contextual understanding. He constructs his understanding of sport management's challenges and future by interpreting historical trends and ethical imperatives through his subjective lens.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Views the field (sport management/physical education) as being in a critical transition phase: experiencing growth ('growth curriculum of the 1980s') but facing an 'uncertain future,' struggling with identity ('need for the field to find a new name, symbol, and image'), and ongoing challenges to its academic legitimacy.                                                                                                                                                                                              | His assessment is deeply rooted in his historical-contextual understanding of the field's evolution, drawing from decades of personal experience. His subjective meaning-making is evident in his 'loss of faith' in the old nomenclature and his urgent call for re-evaluation, reflecting his interpretation of the field's current context and future needs.                                                                                                                                 | Members of the North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM), colleagues, academics, and professionals in sport and physical education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | He positions himself reflexively as a senior statesman and foundational figure (giving the inaugural lecture named after him) offering guidance. This influences his discourse, aiming to shape collective meaning-making and future actions within NASSM based on his interpretations of shared history and challenges.                                                                                                                |

Chelladurai       | The Ohio State University                                                                  |   1991 | Sport Management: Opportunities and Obstacles                                                                                    | The scholar mentions taking his first course in administration of physical education in India forty years prior to 1991, suggesting he was likely in his late 50s or older at the time of the lecture. His Indian origin and subsequent academic career in North America provide a cross-cultural perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | His long career spanning different educational and cultural contexts (India and North America) deeply informs his subjective meaning-making, allowing him to offer a historical and comparative understanding of sport management's development. This personal journey shapes his contextual understanding of the field's evolution from rudimentary concepts to a more complex academic discipline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Foundational aspects of Sport Management as an academic field, including its definition, scope, relationship with other disciplines, internal challenges (e.g., theory vs. practice, specialization), and future development. He is known for work in organizational theory and leadership in sport.                                                       | His focus on the meta-narrative of the field itself is inherently reflexive. He positions himself as an interpreter and shaper of sport management's identity, analyzing its meaning and trajectory from within.

His call for change is a reflexive act, aimed at reshaping the field based on this understanding.                                                                                                                                                                | Early, but with significant potential for maturity. While acknowledging NASSM's 10-year existence and the field's older roots, Slack argues that sport management research 'has not kept pace' with the evolution of the sport world and remains focused on 'formative years' topics. He sees it as needing substantial development to 'grow and flourish.'                                                                                                                                                                    | This assessment stems from his contextual understanding of sport management's history relative to the sport industry's evolution and the maturity of mainstream management. He subjectively interprets its current state as lagging and requiring a paradigm shift, demonstrating his meaning-making process.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Primarily fellow sport management academics, researchers, and educators (specifically NASSM members and JSM readers). Secondarily, practicing sport managers and the broader management academic community.                                                                                                                                                       | His choice of audience (NASSM lecture) underscores his reflexivity; he is directly addressing the community he intends to influence. His arguments are constructed to persuade this specific scholarly group by challenging their prevailing norms while appealing to shared desires for the field's advancement and credibility, thus shaping meaning within that context.                                                             |

Boucher    | University of Windsor                                                                      |   1996 | Toward Achieving a Focal Point for Sport Management: A Binocular Perspective                                                     | The lecture implies Boucher is of a mature career stage, having been a 'practicing manager' for 22 of the preceding 25 years. His examples and references (e.g., Canadian sport system, Dubin Inquiry, addressing 'American friends') suggest a Canadian background or primary operational context. Explicit age and ethnicity are not stated.                                                                                                                                                                                          | His extensive managerial experience forms a crucial part of his subjective meaning-making, grounding his theoretical arguments in perceived practical realities. This lived experience is a primary source for his interpretations of the field's needs. His Canadian context shapes his understanding of sport policy and system development, highlighting the importance of contextual understanding. His self-description as a 'realist who suffers occasional attacks of pragmatism' but revealing 'heretofore hidden idealist tendencies' demonstrates reflexivity concerning his own philosophical leanings and their influence on his argument.                                                                            | The identity and direction of Sport Management as an academic field and professional practice. Specifically, he critiques the overemphasis on commercial/business aspects, discusses the theory-practice gap, and advocates for 'decision-making' as a central, unifying focal point for both research and curricula.                                      | His chosen focus reflects his subjective interpretation of the field's pressing issues and its developmental stage. By questioning the dominant 'business orientation' and advocating for a broader perspective including ethical, social, and experiential dimensions, he engages in meaning-making that challenges existing norms and power structures within the discipline. His desire for a 'focal point' is an attempt to construct a shared meaning for a fragmented field.                           | Early to mid-maturity, in transition. He notes rapid growth and increased recognition ('emerged from a decade of unfettered growth') but also states the field is at a 'fork in the road' with 'different paths' and 'blurred vision,' requiring a reassessment of its direction. He sees it as a 'prosperous time' yet needing to 'refocus'.                                                                                                                                                                                  | His assessment is built on his contextual understanding of the field's recent history and current state. His call to 'reassess' and 'refocus' is a reflexive act, positioning himself as an interpreter of the field's trajectory and a participant in shaping its future narrative. He interprets the field's prosperity not as an endpoint but as an opportune moment for critical self-examination.                                                                                          | Primarily academics and practitioners within Sport Management, specifically attendees of the NASSM Zeigler lecture. He explicitly acknowledges trying to 'satisfy at least two different audiences with somewhat incompatible orientations' (academics and practitioners) and also addresses 'our American friends' separately.                                   | His awareness of a diverse audience with varying subjective realities ('incompatible orientations') directly influences his rhetorical strategies and how he frames his arguments. He positions himself as a potential bridge-builder, demonstrating reflexivity about his communication choices and the need to negotiate meaning across different subgroups within the field.                                                         |

Specific age and ethnicity are not provided in the text. Given the publication year and the nature of the historical review, he is likely an established, mid-to-late career academic. He completed his doctoral dissertation in 1970 at the University of Illinois, where Earle Zeigler was influential.                                                                                                                                             | Paton's position as an established academic in 1997, with historical ties to a key institution (University of Illinois) and figure (Zeigler) during a formative period for sport management, shapes his subjective meaning-making. His perspective is informed by decades of observing and participating in the field's evolution, lending a particular contextual depth to his interpretations of its progress and challenges. His own academic lineage likely influences his emphasis on certain theoretical developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The history, quantity, and quality of administrative/management research in sport and physical education, with a particular emphasis on its theoretical development, methodological rigor, and the influence of key figures like Earle Zeigler. He analyzes textbooks, master's, and doctoral studies.                                                     | Paton's focus on the *evolution* and *interpretation* of research trends reflects a subjective meaning-making process. He is not just reporting facts but constructing a narrative about the field's intellectual journey, selecting and emphasizing aspects he deems significant. This reveals his perspective on what constitutes valuable scholarly progress in sport management.                                                                                                                         | Early to Maturing. Paton notes a 'reemergence' of sport management in the late 1970s/1980s and 'steady progress' in theoretical approaches. However, he also states it must still 'demonstrate our eligibility' through research quality, that work 'has not been systematic,' and it's 'difficult to develop a picture of what we know.' This suggests a field that has made strides but is not yet fully mature or established in its research identity.                                                                     | His assessment is a contextual understanding derived from interpreting historical trends and the state of research in 1997. He is making sense of the field's developmental stage based on his criteria for maturity (e.g., theoretical coherence, systematic research), reflecting his own scholarly values and perspective on how a discipline evolves.                                                                                                                                       | Fellow scholars in sport management and physical education, graduate students, and academic administrators.

This choice emphasizes certain aspects of sport (e.g., market dynamics, corporate ownership) as central to understanding the field, shaping their perspective on what constitutes significant knowledge in sport management.                                                                                                  | The paper implies the phenomenon of vertical integration in sport is in a dynamic, possibly maturing or rapidly expanding stage ('running rampant'). It also references debates on whether vertical integration is 'outdated' or its success is tied to 'maturity of the industry,' suggesting the sport industry context is ripe for such strategies.                                                                                                                                                                         | This reveals the scholar's contextual understanding of the sport industry in 1999 as undergoing significant corporate consolidation. Their engagement with debates about the strategy's timeliness reflects an interpretation of sport management as a field grappling with applying evolving business theories to a specific industrial context.                                                                                                                                               | Primarily academic peers in sport management, students of sport management, and potentially industry professionals interested in strategic management in sport. This is inferred from the theoretical framing, citation practices, and formal tone.                                                                                                               | The choice of an academic framing and audience indicates the scholar is positioning their work within a specific scholarly discourse. This reflexively shapes the contribution as an academic one, aiming to influence how this community understands and discusses vertical integration, rather than, for example, offering direct consultancy to businesses. Meaning is co-constructed with this assumed audience in mind.            |

Her specific research interests (e.g., sport marketing, doctoral education) provide a particular lens through which she interprets and constructs her understanding of the broader field's challenges and opportunities.                                                                                        | Early/Developing. Described as a 'yearling' in academia, 'relatively young,' and at a 'defining moment,' implying it's not yet mature but at a critical juncture for self-definition and growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | This assessment of the field's stage deeply informs her contextual understanding. She sees the field's youthfulness (e.g., NASSM being 15 years old) as both an opportunity for deliberate construction of meaning and a vulnerability if critical self-examination is avoided. Her call to action is framed by this perceived immaturity and the need for active shaping.                                                                                                                      | Primarily sport management academics, researchers, educators, and students, particularly those affiliated with NASSM.

Implied Canadian academic (University of Windsor, references to Canadian data/institutions). Long career in sport management (introduced to the field 'over 20 years ago' prior to 2001). Gender is implied male through common academic conventions of the era and lack of specific female pronouns, though not explicitly stated. Ethnicity and precise age are not stated.                                                                                                     | His established status and extensive experience within the Canadian academic context provide a specific vantage point from which he subjectively interprets the field's challenges and opportunities, particularly concerning hiring. This reflects contextual understanding of academic systems and reflexivity in acknowledging his position and influences within the sport management community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The lecture focuses on academic labor markets in sport management, faculty recruitment and retention, program growth, and the impact of demographic shifts on higher education within this field. This suggests a research interest in academic administration, policy, and the sociology of the sport management profession.                              | His selection of this topic stems from his lived experiences and observations within the academy, shaping his subjective meaning-making around the 'dichotomous perspectives' of 'opportunities' and 'headaches.' This demonstrates a contextual understanding of the discipline's operational challenges and growth dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                               | Weese views sport management as having experienced 'explosive growth' and evolved into 'a respected academic area of study.' This implies a field that has progressed beyond a 'newborn' phase and is in an 'early' to 'maturing' stage, actively confronting challenges associated with rapid expansion and professionalization, such as faculty shortages and defining program scope.                                                                                                                                        | His assessment is an interpretation derived from his longitudinal observation of the field's development. This reflects a contextual understanding of sport management's historical trajectory and its contemporary status within higher education, positioning himself as an informed commentator on this evolution.                                                                                                                                                                           | Explicitly: 'Current graduate students hoping to gain entry to the sport management academy and/or mobile faculty members,' and 'sport management academicians assuming or planning to assume administrative roles.' Implicitly: Fellow established academics, NASSM members, and the broader sport management scholarly community.                               | His explicit tailoring of the lecture to different segments of the academic community acknowledges their unique subjectivities, concerns, and an interpretivist understanding of multiple realities within the field. This shows reflexivity in adapting his discourse to resonate with specific experiences and perspectives, and a contextual understanding of varied roles within the academy.                                       |

As a Zeigler Award recipient in 2002, she is an established scholar, likely in her middle career stage given her discussion of Kram's career stages (e.g., advancement, middle career). Ethnicity is not stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | As a female scholar in 2002, her focus on mentoring, peer relationships, mutual support, and collaborative advancement could reflect her subjective meaning-making shaped by experiences within academia. This perspective may highlight the importance of relational aspects in professional development, possibly influenced by navigating a field where gender dynamics could play a role. Her reflexivity is shown in using her platform to advocate for structures supporting others based on these potentially gendered experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Mentoring in sport management, with a specific emphasis on advocating for Kathy E. Kram's model of peer relationships as an alternative or supplement to traditional, hierarchical mentoring. Focuses on professional development, support systems, and community building within sport management academia.                                               | Her choice to focus on interpersonal dynamics and support systems (mentoring, peer relationships) reflects a subjective understanding that academic success and field development are socially constructed. This aligns with interpretivism by emphasizing how individuals make meaning of their careers and the field through these relationships. It also shows contextual understanding of the specific needs within sport management for such support.                                                   | Developing/Early-to-Mature. She states, 'In order to keep our field moving forward, we must contemplate other areas as well,' and refers to previous Zeigler lectures that 'challenged us and helped us to define and improve our field.' This implies a field that has made progress but still requires active effort to mature, define itself, and improve its internal support structures.                                                                                                                                  | Her perception of sport management as a field still needing improvement and definition reflects a contextual understanding of its ongoing evolution. Her proposals for new mentoring approaches reveal her reflexivity – positioning herself as an agent of change who interprets the field's current context as ripe for new ways of understanding and fostering professional growth.                                                                                                          | Primarily sport management educators, professionals within the North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM), and graduate students in the field. She explicitly addresses 'us as professionals' and makes recommendations for 'NASSM professionals and student members.'                                                                                   | Her direct address to 'us as professionals' and tailored recommendations for NASSM clearly demonstrate reflexivity. She is not an external observer but an active participant speaking to her own community. This shapes her discourse to resonate with their shared context and experiences, aiming to collaboratively construct new meanings and practices for professional development within sport management.                      |

This focus inherently requires understanding phenomena within their specific social and human contexts (contextual understanding).                                                                                                            | Mature but evolving and facing new complexities. She contrasts the sport industry of '30 years ago' with 'today,' noting it's 'in a shape not seen before' and students 'walk in a completely different world.' While acknowledging foundational figures like O’Malley and Mason, her focus is on contemporary, often global, issues that challenge existing paradigms.                                                                                                                                                        | Her assessment reflects a contextual understanding shaped by her personal trajectory within the field. She interprets sport management not as static, but as a dynamic entity constantly being re-shaped and re-interpreted in response to new global, technological, and social contexts. This view underscores the interpretivist idea that meaning is not fixed but emergent.                                                                                                                | Primarily sport management educators and researchers, as explicitly stated ('how does that relate to us as sport management educators and researchers?'). Secondarily, sport management students, as the lecture discusses curricular content for them. The immediate audience is Zeigler Award lecture attendees.                                                | Her address to educators reveals a reflexive understanding of her role, and theirs, in shaping the future meanings, values, and practices of sport management. By targeting educators, she aims to influence the interpretive frameworks passed on to the next generation, demonstrating an awareness of the social construction of the field (reflexivity and contextual understanding).                                               |

This shapes her perspective by prioritizing social justice, equity, and the challenging of dominant paradigms over traditional, purely quantitative measures of scholarly achievement. Her understanding is constructed through engagement with critical theories.                                                   | Mature but requiring significant transformation. McGarry acknowledges the history and established structures of NASSM and sport management (referencing past Zeigler addresses, founding figures) but argues that it is at a stage where critical self-reflection and transformation ('Enact, Discard, Transform') are necessary to address systemic inequities and evolve its understanding of 'impact.'                                                                                                                      | Her assessment reflects a contextual understanding of sport management's evolution. She doesn't see it as 'newborn' but as having developed norms and power structures that now need to be critically examined and changed. This view is shaped by her interpretation of historical trends and current socio-political awareness, indicating a field that is established yet in need of reflexive adaptation to contemporary challenges regarding diversity and social justice.                 | The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) membership, including established scholars, junior faculty, students, and potentially practitioners aware of NASSM. She specifically addresses different segments: 'women who are here,' 'every other badass woman,' 'students and professionals new to NASSM,' 'those of us who’ve been around a while.' | Her direct address to varied segments of the NASSM community shows reflexivity in her positioning as a speaker and leader.

This self-positioning allows him to construct meaning by looking back on personal experiences and systemic issues, influencing his call for change. His Canadian base may offer a distinct perspective on U.S.-dominated sport management discourse, especially concerning topics like collegiate athletics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Theory development and application in sport management, drawing from parent disciplines like organization theory, sociology, political science, and urban affairs. Specific interests include urban regime theory, agency theory, sports facilities, event hosting, and governance. Describes his research program as 'eclectic' and 'all over the place.' | His 'eclectic' approach and focus on applying theories from diverse contexts to sport management demonstrates a subjective meaning-making process, viewing theories as adaptable tools. This aligns with his stated 'constructivist ontology' and highlights a broad contextual understanding derived from engaging with multiple disciplines.                                                                                                                                                               | Mature enough to have established debates (e.g., parent discipline vs. sport-specific theory) and a strong cohort of 'new and ambitious scholars,' but also facing critical challenges like 'suppression of radical potential' and the need for greater inclusivity and diversity. Suggests a field in a phase of critical self-reflection and potential reform rather than nascent development. The field has 'high demand for emerging, capable scholars' and 'collegiality' but also 'brakes' that slow new idea diffusion. | His perspective is informed by his long career (contextual understanding of the field's trajectory) and his personal encounters with theory adoption (subjective meaning-making). He interprets the field as a dynamic social system with conflicting forces shaping its evolution, a characteristically interpretivist view of disciplinary development.                                                                                                                                       | Fellow sport management scholars, particularly those within NASSM (North American Society for Sport Management), previous Zeigler award recipients, current students, emerging scholars, journal editors, and reviewers.

He constructs meaning about sport management primarily as an academic/administrative unit, evaluating its standing and viability within the university system. This reflects a contextual understanding shaped by his daily administrative challenges and priorities.                                                                                                                                     | Early to developing maturity. While acknowledging historical growth and milestones, his emphasis on the 'quasi-profession' status, low accreditation rates, the need to 'clearly establish sport management as a profession,' and that 'there is so much work to be done' suggests he sees it as not yet fully mature or established compared to other disciplines.                                                                                                                                                            | This assessment is contextually derived from his administrative role, comparing sport management to other fields that are more 'omnipresent' or professionally defined. His subjective meaning-making frames this developmental stage as a critical juncture requiring deliberate action, particularly around accreditation.                                                                                                                                                                    | Sport management scholars, faculty, program administrators, NASSM members (as it is a Zeigler lecture). He directly addresses 'scholarly peers, who are in the room with you right now.'                                                                                                                                                                          | He positions himself (reflexivity) as both an insider (Ph.D. in the field) and an outsider-evaluator (Dean's perspective). This dual positioning allows him to deliver a critical message intended to influence the collective meaning-making and future actions of the field's key academic stakeholders.                                                                                                                              |

An urgent need exists for a new, unifying identity.                                                                                                                                   | Through personal confession ('I have lost a certain aspect of the faith—for our name'), citing the multiplicity of unsatisfactory names (HPER, kinesiology, etc.), and urging NASSM to address this as a 'burning question'.                                                                                                                                                                  | Demonstrates subjective meaning-making (his personal 'loss of faith' and dissatisfaction) intertwined with a contextual understanding of the historical struggle for academic status. He attempts to influence the collective interpretation and construction of the field's identity.                                                                                              |

It's an attempt to shape the interpretive framework and value system of his audience, grounded in his contextual understanding of past errors and future needs.                                                                                                    |

She frames the relationship as inherently integrated.                                                                                                                                                                           | Parks subjectively reinterprets the existing discourse within the field, challenging a potentially dominant narrative of division. Her meaning-making seeks to construct a more integrated understanding based on her interpretation of evidence and scholarly ideals.                                                                                                              |

Education must therefore equip them with theoretical understanding, critical thinking skills, and an appreciation for social issues to improve the sport environment.                                                                                                             | Parks explicitly positions students as 'greatest beneficiaries' and future 'change agents,' connecting the scholarship of teaching directly to societal impact and the improvement of sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This reflects her reflexivity regarding the purpose and impact of academic work. She constructs a meaning where scholarship finds its ultimate value in its transformative potential, actualized through educating future professionals. This is based on her interpretation of the educational context and its possibilities.                                                      |

She grounds this by referencing theoretical models (e.g., Chesler & Crowfoot's organizational stages, Bennett's developmental model of intercultural sensitivity) and calling for a shift from mere tolerance to respect and appreciation.                                                                | DeSensi actively constructs and defines 'multiculturalism' for the sport management context, moving beyond simplistic understandings to advocate for a deeply embedded, transformative approach. This reflects her subjective meaning-making process, informed by scholarly literature and a critical interpretation of the field's needs.                                          |

She cites scholars (Lopiano, Kane, Edwards) and specific incidents to substantiate her critique.                                                                                 | Her interpretation of the 'current state of affairs' is built upon synthesizing empirical evidence, scholarly arguments, and observable phenomena (subjective meaning-making). This analysis is deeply rooted in a contextual understanding of historical and ongoing power imbalances within sport.                                                                                |

She emphasizes the critical role of multicultural education in fostering awareness, changing attitudes, and developing intercultural competence.                                             | DeSensi positions her scholarly work as a catalyst for social change, demonstrating a reflexive understanding of academia's potential to influence societal practices (reflexivity). Her call to action is based on her subjective interpretation of what is ethically necessary for the field.                                                                                     |

DeSensi       | The Importance of Self-Reflection in Understanding Diversity                                              | Achieving genuine multicultural understanding requires individuals to critically examine their own backgrounds, biases, prejudices, and behaviors. Self-awareness is foundational to intercultural competence.                                                                                                                                   | Explicitly states: 'Multicultural education is about knowing about others, but more about knowing about yourself.' And, 'When we explore our own thoughts and behaviors...we must consider those individual background factors that may influence our beliefs.' She also notes, 'to varying degrees, we are all elitist, sexist, racist, and homophobic.'                                     | This theme underscores the interpretivist emphasis on the individual's subjective experience and the necessity of reflexivity. Meaning-making about 'others' is intrinsically linked to understanding oneself and one's own social positioning.                                                                                                                                     |

Olafson    | The Legacy and Evolution of Dr. Zeigler's Vision for Sport Management                                     | The field's development is an ongoing dialogue built upon foundational contributions. Respect for intellectual heritage is crucial, and progress involves extending, not just repeating, past insights.                                                                                                                                          | Olafson constructs this by citing Zeigler's initial calls, then tracing how subsequent Zeigler lecturers (Chelladurai, Parks, DeSensi) and he himself have engaged with and expanded upon these core ideas, creating a narrative of continuity and progressive development.                                                                                                                   | This demonstrates Olafson's subjective meaning-making, where he interprets the field's history and current state through the influential lens of Zeigler's work, emphasizing a particular intellectual lineage and shared contextual understanding within the Zeigler lecture tradition.                                                                                            |

Olafson    | The Imperative for a Stronger Theoretical Base in Sport Management Research                               | The scientific credibility and practical utility of sport management research depend on moving beyond descriptive or atheoretical work towards robust, empirically tested theories.                                                                                                                                                              | Through critique of past research (e.g., 'tentative conclusions,' over-reliance on certain metaphors or methods), citation of calls for theoretical grounding (Griffiths, Zeigler), and advocacy for integrating diverse scholarship styles (Boyer).                                                                                                                                          | Reflects Olafson's subjective evaluation of the field's intellectual maturity. He constructs a particular understanding of 'good science' and urges the field to adopt these meaning-making frameworks to advance.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Gordon A. Olafson    | Social Responsibility, Equity, and Multiculturalism in Sport Management                                   | Sport management research and practice must engage with and address broader societal issues of inequality and discrimination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | By prominently featuring DeSensi's (1994) Zeigler lecture on 'social action' and linking it to Zeigler's own 'long-standing concern for equality and equity.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | This highlights Olafson's contextual understanding of sport management as embedded within wider social systems and values, suggesting that meaning-making in the field should incorporate ethical and social justice considerations.                                                                                                                                                |
| Trevor Slack         | Critique of Sport Management's Narrow Research Domain                                                     | The field of sport management has an overly restrictive and outdated focus, primarily examining physical education and athletic programs, thereby neglecting the broader, commercialized 'sport industry.'                                                                                                                                       | Slack produces this meaning by presenting a quantitative analysis of JSM articles (65% focus on PE/athletics), contrasting the historical focus with contemporary sport realities (e.g., Nike, ESPN, sport as 'big business'), and listing numerous unstudied types of sport organizations (e.g., footwear companies, marketing agencies).                                                    | This reflects Slack's subjective meaning-making. He defines the 'sport industry' contextually and expansively, then contrasts this with his interpretation of the field's actual research output, arguing for a necessary re-conceptualization of its scope.                                                                                                                        |
| Trevor Slack         | Need for Greater Theoretical Sophistication from Mainstream Management                                    | Sport management research often lacks theoretical rigor because it fails to adequately incorporate current concepts and theories from the broader field of management.                                                                                                                                                                           | He supports this by referencing historical critiques (Spaeth, Zeigler) of the field's theoretical lag, arguing that theory-deficient studies lack relevance and credibility, and advocating for sustained engagement with leading management journals and scholarly books.                                                                                                                    | Slack subjectively interprets the theoretical state of sport management as 'problematic.' His meaning of 'sound and current theories' is constructed from an external disciplinary context (mainstream management), influencing his call for interdisciplinary theoretical integration.                                                                                             |
| Trevor Slack         | Call for Diversification of Research Topics and Methodologies                                             | The field's over-reliance on descriptive surveys and topics like curriculum or graduate careers limits its ability to understand the complex realities of sport organizations and address pressing managerial concerns.                                                                                                                          | He identifies understudied yet crucial management topics (e.g., strategy, organizational culture, power, technology). He critiques the dominance of quantitative surveys and advocates for a broader methodological toolkit, including qualitative approaches like the biographical method, secondary data analysis, critical theory, and ethnography.                                        | His call for diversification stems from his subjective interpretation of what constitutes robust, insightful research capable of capturing 'organizational realities.' This aligns with interpretivist preferences for rich, contextualized data and multiple ways of constructing knowledge.                                                                                       |

His advocacy is a reflexive act aimed at repositioning sport management more favorably within the wider academic landscape, thereby enhancing its perceived legitimacy and influence.                                                                                  |
| Robert L. Boucher    | The Contested Identity of Sport Management: 'Sport' vs. 'Business'                                        | The field risks losing its essence and ethical grounding by overly prioritizing commercial interests and a 'business orientation' at the expense of the experiential, social, and philosophical dimensions of sport. A rebalancing is needed to prevent 'selling our collective souls'.                                                          | Boucher juxtaposes quotes favoring a business approach with critical perspectives (e.g., Whitson & MacIntosh). He uses examples like O'Malley's beer sponsorship talk and terms like 'sportism' to highlight the perceived imbalance. Rhetorical questions ('Is it right for a sport manager only to be a conduit...?') prompt critical reflection.                                           | This reflects Boucher's subjective meaning-making. He interprets the rise of commercialism not as a neutral development but as a problematic shift with significant moral and philosophical implications for the field's identity. He constructs a narrative of a field potentially losing its way.                                                                                 |
| Robert L. Boucher    | The Theory-Practice Gap: Bridging Academia and the 'Real World'                                           | A significant disconnect exists between academic research (often seen as esoteric) and the practical needs of sport managers. Current approaches to bridge this are insufficient; he proposes research become more practical (e.g., 'appreciative inquiry') and curriculum more theoretical, particularly concerning ethical and social issues.  | He outlines criticisms from both academics and practitioners, citing scholars who advocate for theoretical rigor versus practical application. He uses the analogy of 'studying a truck at rest' to illustrate the limitations of current academic approaches to understanding practice. He proposes specific shifts in research focus (e.g., 'appreciative inquiry') and curriculum content. | Boucher subjectively diagnoses the problem and offers solutions based on his interpretation of the distinct realities and meaning-systems of academics and practitioners. His embrace of 'appreciative inquiry' signals an openness to research paradigms that prioritize understanding context and fostering positive, co-constructed change, aligning with interpretivist values. |
| Robert L. Boucher    | Decision-Making as a Unifying Focal Point                                                                 | Effective, ethical, and well-informed decision-making is the core competency for sport managers and should be the central organizing principle for both sport management research and curriculum. This focus can integrate the field's diverse sub-domains and address its shortcomings.                                                         | He draws on his personal managerial experience ('All problems are people problems. Sound decision-making solves problems.'), cites management theorists (Simon, Vroom), and uses high-profile examples of faulty decision-making (Bay of Pigs, Challenger, Ben Johnson scandal) to underscore its critical importance and consequences. He lists specific decision-making concepts for study. | This is Boucher's primary act of subjective meaning construction. He elevates 'decision-making' as the key interpretive framework for understanding and improving sport management, based on his values, experiences, and reading of organizational challenges. He aims to create a shared meaning or 'focal point' for a field he perceives as fragmented.                         |
| Garth Paton          | Historical Evolution and Legitimation of Sport Management Research                                        | Sport management's journey from a practice-oriented aspect of physical education to a more theoretically-grounded academic subdiscipline is ongoing, and its legitimacy hinges on the quality and coherence of its research.                                                                                                                     | Achieved through a chronological review of the field, highlighting critical periods (e.g., 'Great Debate' of the 1960s), key figures (especially Zeigler), and shifts in textbook content and research focus (e.g., post-1965 move towards theory).                                                                                                                                           | Paton subjectively constructs a narrative of the field's development, emphasizing particular events and contributions.

Zeigler's work is central to this narrative.                                                                                                                                           | Paton interprets this 'shift' as significant 'progress.' This is a subjective valuation, reflecting his belief in the importance of theory for robust academic inquiry and his meaning-making process regarding what constitutes advancement in the field.                                                                                                                          |

James Weese       | Faculty Shortage and Hiring Crisis in Sport Management                                                    | The rapid growth and success of sport management as an academic discipline have paradoxically created a critical vulnerability: a significant shortage of qualified faculty, which threatens educational quality and the field's sustainable development.                                                                                        | Through citing data on faculty searches (Mondello et al., 2001), quoting search committee chairs ('lack of qualified candidates'), personal anecdotes of institutional challenges, and comparisons with other academic fields facing similar shortages (e.g., business, computer science).                                                                                                    | Weese subjectively frames this complex issue as a 'dichotomy' of 'opportunities' for new/mobile faculty and 'headaches' for administrators. This dual perspective is a product of his interpretation of the situation, reflecting his personal concerns and understanding of the field's delicate balance.                                                                          |
| W. James Weese       | Impact of Demographic Shifts on Higher Education and Sport Management                                     | Broad societal demographic trends (e.g., Baby Boom, Baby Bust, Echo Boom cohorts) are powerful, largely unavoidable forces that will profoundly reshape student enrollment patterns and the demand for sport management programs and faculty.                                                                                                    | By referencing the work of demographers (Drucker, Foot, Keller), citing census data (Statistics Canada, U.S. Census Bureau), and explaining concepts like 'population push' and 'participation pull' as drivers of university enrollment.                                                                                                                                                     | He interprets these external demographic trends through the specific lens of sport management academia, constructing a narrative of impending challenges and opportunities. This demonstrates how contextual understanding of broader societal factors shapes his subjective meaning-making regarding the future of the field.                                                      |
| W. James Weese       | The Indispensable Role of Quality Professors and Mentorship                                               | Effective, quality higher education, particularly in sport management, relies heavily on the physical presence, guidance, and mentorship of dedicated professors. Face-to-face interaction and the development of strong student-faculty relationships are crucial and cannot be fully supplanted by distance education or technology.           | Through evocative references to cultural narratives ('Mr. Holland's Opus,' 'Tuesdays with Morrie'), personal opinion ('it is my opinion this type of learning will increase to complement...not replace'), and emphasizing the traditional professorial triad of teaching, research, and service.                                                                                             | This theme reflects Weese's deeply held subjective values regarding the nature of meaningful education. He constructs an argument championing the enduring importance of the traditional professorial role, showcasing reflexivity as his personal educational philosophy shapes his analysis.                                                                                      |
| W. James Weese       | Strategic Program Development and Broadening Scope                                                        | For sport management programs to sustain their growth, avoid market saturation of graduates, and remain relevant, they must adopt a broad, innovative, and strategically adaptive approach. This includes catering to diverse populations (women, disabled, seniors, mass participation) beyond an exclusive focus on elite sport.               | By citing warnings and advice from other scholars (Brassie, Stier, Porter, Chelladurai, Zeigler, Clement) and advocating for programs that are 'current and innovative' and align with 'demographic fit and the needs of our field.'                                                                                                                                                          | Weese subjectively interprets the advice of peers and market signals to construct a strategic vision for the field. His emphasis on contextual adaptation (e.g., to the 'expanding seniors' market') highlights how situational factors should inform programmatic meaning and direction.                                                                                           |
| W. James Weese       | Innovative Recruitment and Retention Strategies for Faculty                                               | Given the acute and worsening faculty shortage, traditional recruitment methods are inadequate. Sport management programs and institutions must adopt creative, proactive, and aggressive strategies to attract, secure, and retain qualified faculty in a highly competitive academic marketplace.                                              | By proposing a range of solutions (increasing PhD program capacity, faculty exchanges, use of visiting scholars and part-time faculty, retaining retirees through phased programs, cluster hiring, competitive compensation packages, spousal hiring programs) and drawing parallels with other competitive academic fields.                                                                  | This reflects his pragmatic, problem-solving orientation, subjectively constructing a call to action based on his interpretation of the market context. His solutions are framed by an understanding of the social and economic realities shaping academic careers.                                                                                                                 |
| Donna L. Pastore     | Critique and Expansion of Traditional Mentoring                                                           | While traditional mentoring is valuable, it has limitations (e.g., availability, hierarchy) and may not fully address the diverse needs of professionals at various career stages within sport management.                                                                                                                                       | By reviewing literature on mentoring definitions, functions, and benefits, then implicitly contrasting it with the advantages of peer relationships (mutuality, availability, duration). She acknowledges mentoring's importance before pivoting to 'a different lens.'                                                                                                                       | This reflects her subjective meaning-making process where she interprets existing knowledge on mentoring and identifies a gap or an area for reinterpretation. It shows contextual understanding by acknowledging established practices before proposing an evolution.                                                                                                              |
| Donna L. Pastore     | Advocacy for Peer Relationships (Kram's Model)                                                            | Peer relationships (information, collegial, special) offer a more mutual, accessible, and potentially enduring form of support that can fulfill many career and psychosocial functions critical for professional development in sport management.                                                                                                | Through detailed exposition of Kram's (1988) framework, including types of peer relationships, their functions, application across career stages (establishment, advancement, middle, late), and advantages like 'mutuality.'                                                                                                                                                                 | This is the core of her subjective meaning-making, where she interprets and champions Kram's theory as a 'different lens' particularly suited to the sport management context. She constructs peer relationships as a vital, perhaps underutilized, mechanism for professional growth and support.                                                                                  |

Pastore     | Actionable Recommendations for NASSM and Individuals                                                      | The sport management field, particularly through its organization NASSM, should proactively foster both improved traditional mentoring (especially for graduate students) and robust peer relationships to enhance the profession and support its members.                                                                                       | By proposing concrete initiatives: mentor-protégé contracts, independent study courses for protégés, a NASSM clearinghouse for peer relationships, a formalized NASSM mentoring program for graduate students, and a new 'Best Practices in Mentoring and Teaching' section in the Journal of Sport Management.                                                                               | Demonstrates strong reflexivity; she positions herself as an advocate for tangible change within her professional community. These proposals are rooted in her contextual understanding of NASSM's role and the needs of sport management academics, aiming to institutionalize supportive, meaning-making interactions.                                                            |
| Donna L. Pastore     | Situating Mentoring within the Legacy of Sport Management Scholarship                                     | Her call to focus on mentoring, and specifically peer relationships, builds upon a tradition of critical self-reflection and leadership within the field, as exemplified by previous Zeigler lecturers and Dr. Zeigler himself.                                                                                                                  | By referencing past Zeigler lecturers (Slack, Pitts, Weese, Olafson), citing Dr. Zeigler's work and personal mentoring attributes (via Chelladurai), she frames her contribution as part of an ongoing dialogue aimed at advancing the field.                                                                                                                                                 | This shows deep contextual understanding, linking her argument to the historical and intellectual lineage of the Zeigler Award. Her interpretation of these past contributions provides a foundation for her own subjective focus, reflecting a reflexive positioning of her work within this respected tradition.                                                                  |

'Merit' is a socially constructed ideal she advocates for, based on her interpretation of the field's internal needs and external perceptions, reflecting her own meaning-making process.                                                                                                              |

Acknowledging this inherent duality is essential for responsible sport management.                                                                                                                                   | Through the titular metaphor and by juxtaposing personal, positive experiences of sport with an extensive list of negative aspects (corruption, exploitation, discrimination, etc.), Frisby constructs sport as a site of conflict and power struggles, not just benign entertainment or business.                                                                                            | Frisby's interpretation challenges a potentially naive or overly optimistic view of sport. Her subjective meaning-making here aims to shift the audience's perception to see sport as a microcosm of broader societal issues, requiring critical scrutiny.                                                                                                                          |
| Wendy Frisby         | Paradigmatic Pluralism and the Role of Epistemology, Ontology, and Methodology                            | No single research paradigm holds a monopoly on truth; different paradigms shape research questions, methods, and findings. Sport management needs to embrace multiple paradigms, including CSS, to achieve a comprehensive understanding.                                                                                                       | Frisby explicitly discusses positivism, interpretivism, criticalism, and postmodernism, outlining their differing epistemological and ontological assumptions. She argues, 'My goal here is not to fuel the ‘paradigm wars’... Rather, I am offering critical social science as a paradigm, not the paradigm.'                                                                                | This directly reflects a core tenet of interpretivism: the acknowledgment that knowledge is constructed through specific lenses. Frisby's subjective meaning-making champions intellectual diversity and critiques paradigmatic insularity.                                                                                                                                         |
| Wendy Frisby         | Call to Action: Transforming Research, Teaching, and Practice                                             | Adopting CSS has profound implications for how sport management is researched (challenging power, aiming for social change), taught (fostering critical thinking, avoiding 'discursive closure'), and practiced (moving beyond profit-centric models to address social issues).                                                                  | Frisby uses rhetorical questions about training and pedagogy, cites her own research as an example of critical praxis, and references Alvesson and Deetz's three tasks (insight, critique, transformative redefinition) to provide a framework for this transformation.                                                                                                                       | This highlights her reflexivity, using her scholarly platform to advocate for specific changes. Her subjective interpretation is that current approaches are insufficient and that CSS offers a path toward more ethical and impactful engagement with sport.                                                                                                                       |
| Laurence Chalip      | The 'Malaise' and Status Insecurity of Sport Management                                                   | The field's struggle for identity, legitimacy, and relevance, characterized by self-doubt and debate over its theoretical foundations and practical utility.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Produced through discourse within the field (citing Cuneen & Parks, Weese, Costa), comparing itself to 'home disciplines,' and anxieties about academic status and institutional placement.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Highlights the subjective experience of scholars within the field. Chalip doesn't just state facts but interprets this 'malaise' as a shared feeling and a symptom of the field's youth, demonstrating subjective meaning-making. He acknowledges the socially constructed nature of academic status.                                                                               |
| Laurence Chalip      | The Call for a 'Distinctive' Sport Management Discipline via Sport-Focused Research                       | Sport management needs to develop its own theories and research questions grounded in unique sport phenomena, rather than solely applying theories from other disciplines, to achieve legitimacy and make unique contributions.                                                                                                                  | Constructed by contrasting a 'Derivative Model' with a 'Sport-focused Model' (Figure 1) and arguing that distinctiveness arises from studying what makes sport management unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Reflects Chalip's subjective interpretation of how the field can achieve maturity and recognition. It's a call to construct a new meaning for sport management research, moving from a borrower to a creator of knowledge specific to its context.                                                                                                                                  |
| Laurence Chalip      | Critique of Sport Legitimations                                                                           | Commonly espoused justifications for sport (health, economic development, etc.) are often inconsistent with actual sport management practices and outcomes, creating a credibility gap.                                                                                                                                                          | Achieved by juxtaposing the popular claims for sport with research evidence that often contradicts or complicates these claims (e.g., sport's limited role in public health campaigns, the problematic nature of economic impact claims).                                                                                                                                                     | This demonstrates a critical approach to subjective meaning-making, urging the field to examine the (mis)alignment between the meanings it promotes (legitimations) and the realities it produces. It focuses on how these legitimations are socially constructed narratives that need scrutiny and contextual understanding.                                                       |
| Laurence Chalip      | Challenging Popular Wisdom/Fallacies about Sport                                                          | Widely held but incorrect beliefs about sport (e.g., 'natural talent fallacy,' 'Amazon athlete fallacy') constrain sport management practice and research, and perpetuate inequities.                                                                                                                                                            | By presenting these 'fallacies,' citing research that debunks them, and illustrating their negative consequences for sport systems and participants (especially women and young athletes).                                                                                                                                                                                                    | This focuses on how shared, often unexamined, beliefs (social constructions) shape understanding and action in sport. Chalip calls for an interpretivist approach to deconstruct these fallacies and understand their impact, emphasizing how subjective beliefs influence the reality of sport.                                                                                    |

Her championing of 'dialogue' highlights a belief that richer, more nuanced understandings emerge from open, collaborative inquiry rather than adversarial debate, reflecting a commitment to shared meaning-making.                                                 |
| Sue Inglis           | Integration and Redefinition of Academic Mandates (Teaching, Research, Service)                           | The traditional pillars of academic life are interconnected and fraught with tensions. Service, particularly, requires re-evaluation towards a more engaged, scholarly, and recognized form, drawing on historical figures like Follett and Zeigler.                                                                                             | Through critical examination of current practices, historical reflection on the values espoused by foundational figures, and posing questions about the balance and valuation of these academic roles within sport management.                                                                                                                                                                | Inglis explores the subjective experiences and values embedded within these academic roles. Her call to rethink 'service' reflects a reflexive engagement with the field's norms and an attempt to reconstruct its meaning in a way that aligns better with evolving scholarly values and societal needs.                                                                           |

This may involve re-evaluating its name (e.g., 'sport management and leadership studies').                                      | Through historical contextualization (NASSM's beginnings, Zeigler's influence), critical questioning of current norms (e.g., publication outlets), and proposing new conceptualizations to stimulate dialogue about the field's scope and purpose.                                                                                                                                            | This demonstrates a profound reflexivity concerning the field's self-perception and external representation. The focus is on the ongoing social construction of 'sport management' as a meaningful and relevant academic endeavor, shaped by internal dialogues and external environmental influences.                                                                              |

This is exacerbated by a lack of grant funding and external rankings.                                                                                          | Through personal anecdotes (e.g., his experiences in dean searches where he was questioned if he was 'education enough,' 'business enough,' etc.), observations about resource disparities, and referencing Chalip (2006).                                                                                                                                                                    | This theme strongly reflects his contextual understanding of university power dynamics, institutional structures, and the politics of academic legitimacy. His assertion that 'people often matter more than structures' is a subjective interpretation derived from his experiences.                                                                                               |

| Lucie Thibault       | The Dichotomy of Sport Globalization: Benefits vs. 'Inconvenient Truths'                                  | Globalization in sport is not a uniformly positive phenomenon; its celebrated advancements often conceal significant ethical, social, and environmental costs, particularly for vulnerable populations and developing nations.                                                                                                                   | Thibault juxtaposes acknowledged benefits (e.g., spread of sports, athlete opportunities) with detailed expositions of negative impacts (labor exploitation, talent drain, media homogenization, environmental damage), using the borrowed phrase 'inconvenient truth' to frame this critical perspective.                                                                                    | This reflects Thibault's subjective meaning-making by challenging dominant, often celebratory, narratives of sport globalization. She constructs an alternative understanding by focusing on marginalized experiences and systemic inequalities, urging a more nuanced and critical interpretation of globalization's impact.                                                       |
| Lucie Thibault       | Labor Exploitation in the Global Sportswear Industry                                                      | The profitability and accessibility of sportswear in developed nations are predicated on the systematic exploitation of labor in developing countries, a moral failing often inadequately addressed by corporate social responsibility initiatives.                                                                                              | Through descriptions of 'pitiful working conditions,' citation of critical reports (e.g., 'Play Fair at the Olympics'), and contrasting TNC profits with worker realities, Thibault constructs the meaning of TNC practices as inherently exploitative despite superficial ethical codes.                                                                                                     | Thibault's subjective interpretation prioritizes the lived experiences of workers. She deconstructs corporate narratives of ethical conduct by focusing on the actual impact on workers, reflecting an interpretivist commitment to understanding meaning from the perspective of those directly affected by power structures.                                                      |
| Lucie Thibault       | Athlete Migration: Opportunity, Exploitation, and 'Deskilling'                                            | While athlete migration offers individual opportunities, it often functions as a mechanism for resource extraction from developing nations by wealthier countries and leagues, leading to a 'deskilling' of donor sport systems and perpetuating global inequalities.                                                                            | By presenting examples of athletes from developing countries being 'poached' or recruited with minimal compensation to their home systems, and the impact on domestic leagues, she constructs athlete migration as a complex issue with significant downsides for global equity.                                                                                                              | This theme showcases Thibault's contextual understanding of how global economic forces intersect with sport. Her interpretation of athlete migration as 'deskilling' or 'poaching' is a subjective framing that highlights power imbalances and questions the fairness of these global flows, rather than viewing them simply as free market talent exchange.                       |
| Lucie Thibault       | Call for Critical Consciousness and Action in Sport Management                                            | Sport management scholars, students, and practitioners have an ethical responsibility to critically examine the 'inconvenient truths' of sport globalization and actively work towards more equitable and sustainable practices.                                                                                                                 | Through a series of rhetorical questions in the 'Discussion' section and direct exhortations ('We need to ask ourselves...'), Thibault constructs this call to action, urging for curriculum changes and critical research.                                                                                                                                                                   | This reflects deep reflexivity. Thibault positions herself and her audience as agents capable of effecting change. She emphasizes the role of academia in shaping understanding and promoting social justice, a hallmark of critical interpretivist scholarship that sees knowledge as intrinsically linked to action and ethical responsibility.                                   |

| Karen Danylchuk      | The Transformative Power of Personal International Experience                                             | Direct, immersive experience in diverse cultural contexts is fundamental to developing genuine 'worldmindedness' and an authentic international perspective, which cannot be fully achieved through academic study alone.                                                                                                                        | Through a detailed personal anecdote about her four years teaching at the Hong Kong International School (HKIS), emphasizing its multicultural environment and her own learning as a minority.                                                                                                                                                                                                | This showcases subjective meaning-making where her personal biography is used to authenticate and make tangible the abstract concept of internationalization. Her lived experience is presented as an exemplar of the understanding she advocates, lending emotional and experiential weight to her arguments.                                                                      |
| Karen Danylchuk      | The Responsibility of Academic Organizations (NASSM) in Fostering Internationalization                    | Professional academic bodies like NASSM have a crucial leadership role and an ethical responsibility to actively promote, facilitate, and embed internationalization within their discipline's teaching, research, and culture.                                                                                                                  | By questioning NASSM's current level of engagement ("So have we become too complacent...?"), referencing its historical pioneering role, suggesting concrete actions (dialogue with other associations, student initiatives), and urging it to expand its vision.                                                                                                                             | This theme demonstrates reflexivity. Danylchuk, as an insider, critically examines her own organization's role. She attempts to reshape its collective understanding and purpose concerning internationalization, thereby influencing the context within which future meaning-making in the field occurs.                                                                           |

He uses the metaphor 'heart and soul'.                                                                                                                                                                   | Shilbury subjectively elevates 'competition' to a core ontological concept for sport management. This framing is a deliberate act of meaning-making, providing the central pillar upon which his subsequent arguments about strategy are built.                                                                                                                                     |

His meaning-making process involves evaluating the field against an ideal where strategy research is prominent.                                                                                                                                    |
| David Shilbury       | Context as Key to Understanding Sport Management's Uniqueness                                             | The distinctive features of sport management are more likely to be revealed through the application of generic theories (like strategy) in diverse sport-specific contexts, rather than through unique sport-only theories.                                                                                                                      | By highlighting diverse research contexts (e.g., Canadian NSOs, New Zealand NSOs, professional sport) and arguing, 'Context, therefore, is most likely to reveal what, if any, ‘special features’ of sport management might exist.'                                                                                                                                                           | This emphasizes contextual understanding as paramount. Shilbury subjectively interprets the search for disciplinary distinctiveness as a matter of perspective and application, moving away from essentialist claims of uniqueness.                                                                                                                                                 |

She constructs interdisciplinarity as a more evolved and effective way of knowing, challenging the perceived limitations and fragmentation ('silos,' 'microtheorizing') of dominant monodisciplinary approaches.                                                                                                      |
| Alison Doherty       | The 'Village' Metaphor: Collaboration and Community in Research                                           | Knowledge creation is, or should be, a communal and collaborative effort. Complex problems inherently require diverse perspectives and shared effort ('it takes a village'). This collaborative spirit enriches both personal and professional life.                                                                                             | Through the titular metaphor, explicit connection to personal philosophy ('resonates with my personal and work life. It is a philosophy that I truly believe'), references to proverbs ('two heads are better than one'), and historical/cultural attributions of the phrase.                                                                                                                 | This strongly reflects her subjective meaning-making, where a personal life philosophy directly shapes her academic argument for how research should be conceptualized and conducted. It emphasizes the social construction of knowledge.                                                                                                                                           |

Cunningham | Collective Action via Academia (Teaching, Research, Service)                                              | Sport management academicians possess a unique capacity and therefore a responsibility to actively foster social change through their core professional activities.                                                                                                                                                                              | Articulated through specific calls to action: adopting critical pedagogy and community-engaged learning in teaching; developing theories for equality and employing diverse research methodologies (including critical/emancipatory approaches); and focusing service on creating inclusive sport spaces and translating research for broader impact.                                         | Demonstrates high reflexivity regarding the role and potential influence of academics. It positions the academic community not as neutral observers but as active constructors of meaning and agents of social transformation within their specific professional context.                                                                                                           |

His application of this theory is an act of meaning-making, proposing it as a conceptual tool to help scholars better understand and investigate complex sport phenomena in a more nuanced and contextually relevant way.                                                                                                   |

He also links this to practical benefits like grant acquisition.                                                                                                                | This reflects Zhang's strong subjective criteria for valuable research. He constructs meaning around 'good' scholarship as that which is deeply embedded in the practical realities of sport, capable of generating concrete insights, thus emphasizing subjective meaning-making oriented towards pragmatic outcomes.                                                              |
| James Jianhui Zhang  | Viability and Challenges of Sport Management in Research Universities                                     | Sport management programs, due to the field's applied nature and challenges in securing external research funding, face significant hurdles in achieving and maintaining legitimacy, resources, and respect within research-intensive universities.                                                                                              | By discussing the 'long-term viability,' 'pecking order,' 'tenuous position' of faculty, and the necessity of external funding beyond tuition. He shares his personal efforts ('naïve attempt') in grant acquisition.                                                                                                                                                                         | This demonstrates a critical contextual understanding of the institutional environment shaping the discipline. His reflexivity is evident as he connects these systemic pressures to research priorities ('what to study and how to study') and shares his own experiences navigating this context.                                                                                 |

It is deeply embedded ('hiding in plain sight') and normalized within sport culture.                                                                                                                                                   | Through direct definitions, contrasts with sexism in other industries (e.g., 'Mad Men episode feel'), citing examples of overt sexism, and referencing scholarly work on dominant discourses and institutionalized norms.                                                                                                                                                                     | This reflects Fink's subjective meaning-making, where she interprets sport as a unique context where sexism manifests differently. She constructs this meaning by drawing on shared cultural references and academic frameworks, highlighting how certain behaviors become 'taken for granted'.                                                                                     |

This subjective interpretation emphasizes the lived experiences of those affected and the systemic nature of the harm, moving beyond abstract critique.                                                                                                               |
| Janet S. Fink        | A Call to Action: Moving Beyond 'Admiring the Problem' to Systemic Change                                 | Mere awareness or documentation of sexism is insufficient; proactive, systemic change is required. This involves adopting alternative frames (like Shaw and Frisby's) to critique and transform taken-for-granted practices.                                                                                                                     | By referencing previous calls to action (Cunningham), advocating for Shaw and Frisby's alternative approach, suggesting applications in research and teaching, and providing examples of positive momentum (e.g., 'Like a Girl' campaign).                                                                                                                                                    | This theme showcases Fink's reflexivity – she positions herself and her audience as agents of change. Her call for 'undoing gender' and working with sport organizations reflects a contextual understanding that meanings are not fixed and can be re-negotiated through collective, situated action.                                                                              |

James     | Call to Action for Program Improvement and Critical Reflection                                            | The responsibility lies with faculty within individual programs and with NASSM as an association to critically evaluate and enhance doctoral training, specifically by integrating philosophical inquiry to produce well-rounded, critical scholars rather than mere 'tool users'.                                                               | Meaning is produced through direct exhortations: 'evaluate one’s program,' 'determine whether students... are being challenged to understand philosophy,' and suggesting NASSM should consider expectations for doctoral training.                                                                                                                                                            | This demonstrates his reflexivity, as he positions himself and his colleagues as agents of change. He urges a collective contextual understanding that the quality of future scholars depends on current actions, a meaning he constructs through his analysis.                                                                                                                     |

The term 'uncomfortably slow' itself is a strong subjective evaluation.                                                                                         | This reflects his subjective meaning-making, where he interprets quantitative data (citation lags) and personal experience through the lens of 'comfort' and 'speed,' creating a powerful narrative about the challenges in the field. It's his interpretation of what the data signifies for scholars.                                                                             |
| Daniel C. Funk       | The Academic Publishing Ecosystem (Journals, Editorial Boards, Networks)                                  | The structures of academic publishing, including journal hierarchies, the role of editorial boards as gatekeepers, and the nature of co-authorship networks, significantly mediate the diffusion of knowledge.                                                                                                                                   | Through quantitative analysis of journal citations, editorial board compositions (size, tenure, institutional representation), and a reflective analysis of his own co-author network (strong vs. weak ties).                                                                                                                                                                                 | Funk's interpretation of this ecosystem is shaped by his contextual understanding of academic norms and his subjective experiences as an author, reviewer, and collaborator. He presents this not as an objective system but as a socially constructed environment with specific dynamics.                                                                                          |
| Daniel C. Funk       | Strategies for Navigating Knowledge Diffusion                                                             | Emerging scholars can proactively enhance the diffusion of their research by understanding the ecosystem, setting realistic goals, strategically building co-author networks, and engaging in programmatic research to reinvest in their ideas.                                                                                                  | Derived from his analysis of diffusion challenges and his personal experiences (e.g., programmatic research on PCM, diverse co-author network). He offers these as actionable advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | This shows reflexivity, as he positions himself as a mentor translating his interpretations into practical guidance. The strategies themselves are a product of his subjective meaning-making about what constitutes effective scholarly practice in the given context.                                                                                                             |
| Daniel C. Funk       | Relevance of Diffusion to Theory Development Debates                                                      | The ongoing debate about whether sport management should focus on derivative (applying external theories) versus sport-specific theory development should also consider the implications for knowledge diffusion, as neither pathway inherently guarantees faster spread.                                                                        | By linking the existing scholarly debate (referencing Chalip, Slack) to his empirical findings on citation patterns of articles following both approaches, suggesting diffusion speed is not determined by this choice alone.                                                                                                                                                                 | Funk reinterprets a significant contextual debate within the field through his chosen framework of diffusion. This is an act of subjective meaning-making, proposing a new perspective ('a third perspective') to understand an established disciplinary conversation.                                                                                                              |
| Jennifer E. McGarry  | Redefining Scholarly Impact Beyond Traditional Metrics                                                    | True scholarly impact transcends citation counts and journal rankings; it involves tangible positive influence on practice, policy, social justice, and fostering inclusivity. Current evaluation systems are often misaligned with these broader goals.                                                                                         | McGarry constructs this meaning by contrasting traditional views with a 'pluralistic' definition from the Academy of Management report, citing past Zeigler winners' calls for practical relevance (Parks, Weese), highlighting scholar-activists (Evanovich, Cooper, Burton), and critiquing evaluation systems that incentivize 'wrong behaviors.'                                          | This reflects McGarry's subjective meaning-making process, where she actively reinterprets 'impact' through a critical, values-laden lens. She challenges the dominant, often positivist, understanding by foregrounding qualitative, societal, and ethical dimensions, aligning with interpretivist emphasis on context-specific and value-driven knowledge.                       |
| Jennifer E. McGarry  | Addressing Systemic Inequities: Sexism, Racism, and Exclusion in Sport Management                         | Sport management and its organizations (like NASSM) are not meritocratic or neutral; they are embedded with systemic biases (sexism, racism, in-groups/out-groups) that marginalize individuals and limit the field's potential. These issues must be explicitly named and confronted.                                                           | She uses statistics on NASSM demographics, NASSM climate survey results, personal anecdotes (her own, Donna Pastore's), cites scholars discussing sexism (Fink) and racism (Singer, Armstrong, DuBois, DiAngelo), and points to the underrepresentation of Black scholars as evidence of these systemic issues.                                                                               | McGarry's subjective meaning-making is informed by critical theories (feminism, critical race theory). She constructs a narrative that challenges the 'taken-for-granted' assumptions of the field, revealing how power relations and social identities shape experiences and opportunities, a core tenet of interpretivist inquiry into social realities.                          |
| Jennifer E. McGarry  | Call to Action: Individual and Collective Responsibility for Transformation ('Enact, Discard, Transform') | Meaningful change in sport management requires both individual commitment (e.g., critical teaching, mentorship, advocacy) and collective institutional efforts (e.g., reforming NASSM policies, leadership, culture) to disrupt the status quo and create a more inclusive and impactful field.                                                  | She issues direct calls to action ('Amplify each other’s voices,' 'Enact, Discard, Transform'), provides concrete examples of individual actions (colleagues' work, her own teaching), suggests organizational changes for NASSM, and invokes inspirational figures (Wambach, Hill, Raisman) who embody transformative action.                                                                | This theme highlights the reflexive aspect of interpretivism, where the scholar positions herself and the audience as active agents capable of constructing new realities. Meaning is not just interpreted but enacted. Her call emphasizes that shared understanding and collective action can reshape the field's context and values.                                             |

Meaning is constructed as an experiential, relational process.                                                                                                                                                        | Emphasizes the subjective experience of learning and growth ('when I am open and listening, I can learn so much'). Her examples show how individual interactions and diverse contexts shape her understanding, reflecting subjective meaning-making and contextual understanding.                                                                                                   |

She uses metaphors of a journey ('research journey,' 'turning points,' 'road trip') and storytelling, citing Isabelle Allende on memory.                                                                         | This is a prime example of subjective meaning-making. Taks actively constructs a coherent and meaningful narrative from her 40-year career, interpreting past events and interactions through her chosen framework. This framework itself is a product of her interpretation of how knowledge is developed.                                                                         |

Early methods were often insufficient or misleading.                                                                                                                | She details her shift from standard Economic Impact Analysis to Cost-Benefit Analysis, from tangible to intangible impacts (social, well-being), and methodological refinements like differentiating 'other-referenced' vs. 'self-referenced' social impact items after critical feedback. She highlights the ambiguity and challenges in measurement.                                        | Her evolving approach demonstrates how subjective interpretations of research findings (e.g., limited economic benefits, overrated social impacts) and contextual interactions (e.g., discussions with Bob Heere on 'wording matters') lead to a re-construction of meaning and methodology. This reflects a deep contextual understanding of research practice.                    |
| Marijke Taks         | Public Funding, Accountability, and Sustainability of Sport Events                                        | There's an ethical imperative for publicly funded sport events to deliver meaningful and sustainable benefits to host residents (taxpayers), which often are not purely economic.                                                                                                                                                                | She consistently emphasizes 'public funds,' 'taxpayers,' 'accountability,' and the search for 'positive outcomes for host residents' and 'sustainable outcomes.' She critiques findings of limited economic/tourism impact and questions the 'bread and circuses' justification, pushing towards social well-being and participation.                                                         | Her interpretation of 'value' and 'benefit' is socially constructed around community well-being and fairness. This reflects a contextual understanding of the socio-political obligations of public investment and reflexivity about the role of sport management research in advocating for these broader outcomes.                                                                |

This narrative is built on specific research projects and their (often challenging) findings.                                                                      | This theme shows her subjective meaning-making evolving through empirical engagement and disappointment. Her understanding of event impact is reconstructed based on these contextual interactions with LSOs and research results, leading to a more critical and nuanced interpretation of event potential.                                                                        |

He interprets theory development as a socially constructed and mediated phenomenon, challenging purely rationalist views of knowledge advancement and highlighting the lived experience of scholars within this process.                                                                                                |

He explicitly states his research is 'driven by my interest in theory and using theory to understand specific (sporting) contexts.'                                                                          | This reflects his constructivist ontology and subjective meaning-making process, where theories are seen as flexible tools for interpretation. His engagement with diverse disciplines shows a commitment to contextual understanding, enriching sport management by looking outward.                                                                                               |
| Daniel S. Mason      | Scholarly Reflexivity, Responsibility, and Addressing Systemic Barriers                                   | Scholars, particularly senior ones, must engage in critical self-reflection regarding their research, privilege, and impact. There's a responsibility to identify and dismantle systemic barriers (e.g., lack of diversity, sexism, racism) that hinder the 'radical potential' of others and limit the field's theoretical advancement.         | Achieved through explicit statements of self-critique ('I should have been focusing more on the barriers'), acknowledgment of privilege, and a concluding call to action that shifts focus from individual theory promotion to fostering an inclusive environment for diverse theoretical contributions.                                                                                      | This is a powerful display of reflexivity. Mason positions himself within the field, acknowledges his past approaches, and reinterprets his role based on a broader contextual understanding of social justice issues. His meaning-making evolves towards a more socially responsible stance.                                                                                       |

Mason      | The Nature and Challenges of Sport Management as a Discipline                                             | Sport management is a 'nebulous and, at times, contested' field characterized by diverse ontological stances and ongoing debates about its identity and legitimacy. It faces internal challenges like scholarly gatekeeping and external pressures related to societal inequities.                                                               | Mason articulates this through direct commentary on the field's characteristics, referencing its historical development (e.g., citing Slack, Chalip on theory debates), and discussing issues such as reviewer biases and the critical concerns raised by previous Zeigler lecturers (e.g., Cunningham, Fink).                                                                                | This demonstrates a nuanced contextual understanding of sport management as a socially constructed discipline with its own evolving power structures and internal discourses.

He constructs the lack of these characteristics as a fundamental threat, reflecting a desire to elevate the field's standing based on established sociological markers of professional status (contextual understanding).                                                                                        |

His emphasis is shaped by his contextual experience of what constitutes effective advocacy in higher education resource battles.                                                                                                                  |

His meaning-making process emphasizes that individual program failings have broader reputational consequences, a perspective likely informed by his administrative duty to oversee multiple programs (contextual understanding and reflexivity on the field's collective identity).   |

Paton's work builds upon and acknowledges Zeigler's foundational efforts, suggesting a relationship of scholarly respect and intellectual lineage, possibly mentorship given Paton's PhD from Illinois during Zeigler's tenure there.                   | This highlights the social construction of scholarly influence and Paton's contextual understanding of key individuals shaping the field. His reflexivity is shown in acknowledging this lineage, which underpins his own perspective.                                                                                                                    |

CSS is presented as a tool to understand and transform these relationships.                                                                                                                                                             | This highlights contextual understanding by embedding organizations within broader socio-political power dynamics. It also reflects subjective meaning-making about the ethical responsibilities of research to address injustice and give voice to the less powerful.                                                                                    |

It shows an interpretivist commitment to understanding meaning in context and potentially facilitating change based on that understanding. |
| Laurence Chalip      | Sport Management Scholars --- 'Home Disciplines'                                                                                                                                              | A relationship of dependence, aspiration, and tension. Sport management borrows theories but seeks distinctiveness and equal status, often feeling 'derivative' or engaging in 'self-deprecating practice'.                                                                                                                                                                                 | This reveals the powerful influence of disciplinary context and history on sport management's self-perception (reflexivity). The desire for recognition from established fields shapes how sport management scholars construct their own field's meaning and value (subjective meaning-making).                                                           |

Chalip suggests active engagement and consultancy can be mutually beneficial for theory testing and development.                                                                                                                                                 | Highlights the different meaning-systems and priorities of academia versus industry. Chalip calls for bridging this gap, suggesting a need to understand and integrate these different contextual understandings for the field's growth and perceived relevance.                                                                                          |

Legitimations (claims about sport's benefits) are espoused by sport advocates and organizations, but actual management practices may not optimize or even support these claims, leading to a credibility issue.                                                                                                                                | Chalip uses this to show how socially constructed meanings (legitimations) can diverge from observable realities (practices). His analysis calls for a contextual understanding of why these misalignments occur and for reflexive research to bridge this gap, ultimately re-shaping the subjective meaning of 'good' or effective sport management.     |

Chalip argues for exploring and building linkages to achieve shared objectives and enhance sport's value.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | This highlights the contextual understanding that sport does not exist in a vacuum. The meaning and value of sport management can be enhanced by recognizing and cultivating these interdependencies, moving from an isolated view to an integrated one.                                                                                                  |

TNCs' codes of conduct are often insufficient to alter this dynamic.                                                                                                            | Thibault's construction of this relationship highlights power imbalances and ethical failures, reflecting a contextual understanding of global capitalism's impact on human lives.

Athletes may benefit individually but the systemic impact can be negative for their home countries. | This mapping demonstrates a contextual understanding of neocolonial dynamics within sport. Thibault's interpretation highlights the unequal power relations and reflexively calls for consideration of fairness and reinvestment, moving beyond a simple narrative of athlete opportunity.                                                                |

This relationship shapes sport rules, presentation, and accessibility, potentially at the expense of diversity and critical reporting.                                              | This analysis shows how Thibault interprets the construction of sport's meaning and value as a product of powerful interlocked interests. Her reflexive use of the 'ménage à trois' metaphor encourages a critical view of this context and its implications for sport's cultural role.                                                                   |

This relationship is one of constructive challenge.                                                                                                     | This highlights the contextual understanding of power dynamics within the field. McGarry reflexively uses her platform to give voice to these relationships, interpreting them as sites where meaning (about belonging, value, impact) is contested and needs to be renegotiated.                                                                         |

| Earle F. Zeigler     | Earle F. Zeigler conceptualizes sport management (and its antecedents) as a field whose meaning and trajectory are actively constructed through the interplay of historical context, institutional forces, and the subjective experiences and ethical choices of its professionals. His lecture is an act of interpretivist scholarship itself: he reflexively uses his own storied career as a primary text to interpret the field's past struggles for identity and legitimacy (contextual understanding), to make subjective sense of its current 'uncertain future,' and to advocate for a 'positive meliorism'—a shared framework for meaning-making and purposeful action. He emphasizes that understanding 'why' (the motivations, the values, the historical underpinnings) is paramount for navigating 'what' to do next, championing a process of continuous, conscious interpretation and re-interpretation by NASSM and its members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| P. Chelladurai       | P. Chelladurai conceptualizes sport management as a dynamically evolving field, rich with opportunity but fraught with 'growing pains.' His analysis is deeply rooted in interpretivist principles: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making** is evident in his use of personal anecdotes (the 'scum gutter'), his interpretations of inter- and intra-field tensions (e.g., 'patronizing attitudes,' 'holier-than-thou' stances), and his personal framing of the field's challenges and aspirations. 2) **Contextual Understanding** permeates his lecture, as he consistently situates sport management within the broader academic landscape (its relationship with 'mother disciplines,' allied fields, and more established areas like sport sociology), its historical development, and its societal relevance. He sees the field's identity and challenges as shaped by these contexts. 3) **Reflexivity** is central, as he explicitly positions himself as a senior member of the NASSM community ('all of you and I'), acknowledges the influence of his mentor (Zeigler), and directly addresses his peers to collectively shape the field's future. He is not an objective observer but an active participant in constructing the meaning and trajectory of sport management, using the lecture as a platform to influence that construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Janet B. Parks       | Janet B. Parks conceptualizes sport management as a developing field needing to define its purpose beyond mere financial success. Her lecture strongly embodies interpretivist principles: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making** is evident in her use of the 'Calf Path' metaphor, her reframing of the theory-practice debate, her selection and interpretation of Boyer's framework, and her insistence on an 'other bottom line' focused on social issues. She actively constructs meaning and urges the audience to adopt her interpretations. 2) **Contextual Understanding** is paramount as she situates sport management within its historical development, its relationship to broader societal problems (sexism, racism), and its interdisciplinary academic context. The behavioral issues she highlights are understood as deeply embedded in specific social and cultural contexts. 3) **Reflexivity** is demonstrated through her positioning of herself and the academic community as agents responsible for shaping the field's future. She reflects on the role and impact of scholarship, particularly teaching, in fostering change. Her critique is an invitation for the field to reflect on its own practices and choose a more 'enlightened path.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Joy T. DeSensi       | Dr. DeSensi conceptualizes sport management not as an objective, value-neutral domain, but as a socially constructed field profoundly shaped by, and often perpetuating, wider societal power dynamics and cultural norms, especially concerning race and gender. Her lecture embodies interpretivism through: 1. **Subjective Meaning-Making**: She actively constructs 'multiculturalism' as an ethical imperative, interprets data on discrimination through a critical lens, and infuses her analysis with personal conviction ('my belief,' 'my hope'). 2. **Contextual Understanding**: Her arguments are deeply embedded in the socio-historical context of the early 1990s, referencing contemporary issues (Title IX, 'politically correct' debates), demographic shifts (Workforce 2000), and the intellectual lineage of sport philosophy (Zeigler). She analyzes sport organizations as products of their cultural environments. 3. **Reflexivity**: DeSensi is highly reflexive, explicitly acknowledging how personal factors ('gender, race, ethnic heritage') shape biases and perspectives for everyone, including herself. She positions her lecture as an intervention intended to provoke 'social action,' demonstrating awareness of her role and potential impact as a scholar in shaping the field's consciousness and future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Gordon A. Olafson    | Gordon A. Olafson, in his 1994 Zeigler Lecture, conceptualizes sport management as a field that, while having established some foundational structures, stands at a critical juncture requiring a significant leap in theoretical sophistication and methodological innovation. His analysis is deeply informed by interpretivist principles:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

He emphasizes that 'meaning' (e.g., 'what do the findings mean?') is paramount and that researchers' attributes (curiosity, creativity) are key to uncovering deeper meanings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

He acknowledges the influence of other disciplines and situates his call for change within the broader context of evolving scientific thought (chaos theory impacting many fields).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

He critically assesses the field's dominant research paradigms and metaphors ('machines or organisms'), reflects on his own academic lineage under Zeigler, and consciously positions himself as an agent of change, urging his colleagues and future scholars toward 'a new direction' and 'more enlightened path.' His lecture itself is an act of shaping the collective understanding and future trajectory of sport management scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Trevor Slack         | Trevor Slack conceptualizes sport management as a field at a pivotal moment, possessing unrealized potential due to its adherence to a historically narrow domain and theoretical insularity. His analysis is deeply interpretivist: 1) Subjective Meaning-Making: He actively constructs meanings for key terms like 'sport industry' (broad, commercial) versus the field's traditional focus ('locker room'), using personal conviction ('I want to argue,' 'I believe') to drive his narrative. 2) Contextual Understanding: His arguments are embedded in a rich understanding of multiple contexts – the historical trajectory of sport management, the dynamic evolution of the global sport industry, the academic landscape of mainstream management, and the socio-cultural perception of sport as 'big business.' He posits that the field's primary challenge is its failure to adapt its interpretative frameworks to these evolving contexts. 3) Reflexivity: Slack is overtly reflexive, acknowledging his own standpoint ('my own position as an organizational theorist') and leveraging his Zeigler Award platform to actively shape the discourse and direction of the field he is analyzing. He critiques its outputs (JSM) and institutions (NASSM) from an insider's perspective, aiming to inspire a collective re-interpretation of the field's purpose and potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

His advocacy for 'decision-making' as a focal point is his subjective endeavor to impose a new, unifying meaning and direction onto the field, heavily informed by his personal managerial experiences and values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

His call for critical/reflective competencies in managers mirrors his own reflective approach to analyzing the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Garth Paton          | Garth Paton conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic and evolving field whose identity and legitimacy are actively constructed through the scholarly discourse and research output of its members. His analysis is deeply rooted in contextual understanding, meticulously tracing the field's historical trajectory from its origins within physical education, pinpointing critical junctures like the 1960s 'Great Debate' and the subsequent theoretical turn, and acknowledging the profound influence of key figures, most notably Earle F. Zeigler. Paton engages in subjective meaning-making by interpreting trends in research (e.g., the shift towards theory, persistent descriptive methodologies), evaluating their significance (e.g., 'progress,' 'serious indictment'), and thereby constructing a compelling narrative of the field's development, its achievements, and its ongoing challenges. Reflexivity is evident as he positions himself as a scholar contributing to this very discourse; he is not a detached observer but an active participant who critiques the past, assesses the present, and advocates for specific future directions. He consciously aims to shape the field's self-perception and its research agenda, urging for an approach that marries theoretical rigor with practical applicability. His work itself is an exemplar of interpretivist scholarship—an engaged, historically informed, and critical interpretation of how a field makes sense of itself and strives for intellectual maturity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Dennis R. Howard     | Dennis R. Howard conceptualizes sport management through a deeply interpretivist lens, weaving together subjective meaning-making (e.g., 'Golden Era is over,' valuing 'authentic' fan experiences), contextual understanding (historical comparisons, socio-economic shifts, PLC model), and reflexivity (positioning himself as an educator, fan, and long-standing academic). He constructs a narrative of major league sports facing economic and existential crises due to internal financial structures and alienation of traditional fans, while simultaneously identifying growth and opportunity in more accessible minor league and niche sports. His analysis is shaped by personal history, scholarly expertise in economics, and a clear sense of responsibility towards his academic audience and the future of the field. He sees sport management not as fixed entities but as a dynamic interplay of forces, values, and decisions, open to interpretation and change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| David K. Stotlar     | David K. Stotlar conceptualizes sport management, specifically the phenomenon of vertical integration, primarily through an economic and strategic business lens. His subjective meaning-making is evident in the selection and interpretation of corporate actions (Disney, News Corp., Time-Warner) as exemplars of vertical integration, and in his engagement with varying theoretical perspectives (Mintzberg, Harrigan) to frame the discussion. Contextual understanding is demonstrated by situating these corporate strategies within the specific techno-economic environment of the late 1990s (rise of media conglomerates, internet emergence, regulatory climate) and the particularities of the sport industry (content dependency, league structures). Reflexivity is subtly present in his choice to frame the issue for an academic audience, his acknowledgment of debates and alternative nomenclatures ('divisionalized corporation'), and the concluding open-ended question about the 'madness,' which positions him not as a detached observer but as an interpreter grappling with the implications of these powerful trends. He constructs understanding by weaving together theory, corporate narratives, regulatory actions, and potential impacts, presenting a multi-layered interpretation of vertical integration's significance in sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Brenda G. Pitts      | Brenda G. Pitts conceptualizes sport management as a socially constructed field of study, actively shaped by the interpretations, practices, and reflexivity (or lack thereof) of its scholarly community. She emphasizes subjective meaning-making by repeatedly calling for critical examination of definitions, assumptions ('box thinking'), and the scope of inquiry, arguing that the field's identity is not inherent but built through collective discourse and action. Her analysis is deeply rooted in contextual understanding, referencing the field's historical development (NASSM's age, origins of programs), its relationship with other disciplines, and the specific socio-temporal moment of 'the millennium.' Pitts demonstrates reflexivity by explicitly stating the origins of her own perspective, positioning herself within the academic community she addresses ('we,' 'us'), and urging that community to become more aware of how its collective choices in research, teaching, and professional organization shape the field's reality and credibility. Her lecture is a call for more conscious, critical, and expansive meaning-making to define sport management's future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| W. James Weese       | W. James Weese conceptualizes sport management as a rapidly maturing academic field whose very success has engendered significant challenges, primarily concerning the recruitment and retention of qualified faculty. His analysis is deeply informed by subjective meaning-making, evident in his central 'Opportunities and Headaches' dichotomy, the integration of personal experiences and values (e.g., the importance of face-to-face teaching), and explicitly stated opinions. He demonstrates profound contextual understanding by intricately linking the internal dynamics of sport management academia to broader socio-demographic trends (e.g., 'population push'), the historical evolution of the field, and the operational realities of university systems. Reflexivity is apparent as Weese positions himself within the scholarly community, acknowledges the influence of his mentors, and consciously tailors his discourse to the varied perspectives of his audience (graduate students, administrators). He constructs a narrative wherein the future quality and sustainability of sport management education are contingent upon the professoriate, urging strategic, ethical, and contextually aware action from all stakeholders. His worldview is that of an experienced, concerned insider, using his platform to interpret current realities and advocate for the field's responsible stewardship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Donna L. Pastore     | Donna L. Pastore conceptualizes sport management as an evolving academic field whose progress and the well-being of its members are deeply intertwined with the quality of interpersonal relationships and support systems. Her lecture is a strong example of interpretivist scholarship because she centers her analysis on (1) Subjective Meaning-Making, by proposing 'a different lens' to reinterpret mentoring through Kram's peer relationship model and by drawing on her own convictions; (2) Contextual Understanding, by situating her arguments firmly within the specific historical and contemporary context of sport management academia, NASSM, and its members' lived experiences (e.g., career stages, professional pressures); and (3) Reflexivity, by explicitly positioning herself as an advocate within her professional community, using her platform to propose changes that aim to reshape shared understandings and practices regarding professional support and development. She argues that the field co-constructs its meaning and future through these vital interpersonal connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Jacquelyn Cuneen     | Jacquelyn Cuneen conceptualizes sport management as an academic discipline actively constructing its identity and legitimacy, striving to transition from an 'era of potential' to an 'era of merit.' Her analysis is deeply interpretivist, emphasizing subjective meaning-making through her interpretation of student behaviors (e.g., 'mooks,' 'midriffs'), the significance she attributes to program approval as a marker of quality, and her impassioned valuation of teaching and service. Contextual understanding is paramount, as she frames the field's journey historically and situates its challenges within broader societal shifts like student consumerism and generational value differences. Reflexivity is evident as she speaks from within the NASSM community (using 'we,' 'our'), acknowledging her role in shaping its discourse and explicitly aiming to persuade her peers towards her constructed vision of a 'meritorious' field.

| Wendy Frisby         | Wendy Frisby conceptualizes sport management as a field whose understanding of itself and its subject matter (sport) is significantly constrained by the dominance of positivist and managerialist paradigms. Through an interpretivist lens, her lecture argues for the crucial role of Critical Social Science (CSS) in revealing the multifaceted and often problematic nature of sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                      | Subjectively, she constructs meaning by framing the current state as a 'cost' and CSS as an essential corrective, emphasizing the 'bad and ugly' to challenge taken-for-granted positive assumptions about sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

His analysis is deeply interpretivist:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

He dissects how 'legitimations,' 'fallacies,' and 'narratives' about sport are socially constructed meanings that require critical interpretation. His call for a 'sport-focused' agenda is itself an attempt to guide the collective meaning-making process towards a 'distinctive' understanding of the discipline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                      | 2.  **Contextual Understanding**: Chalip repeatedly situates sport management's challenges and opportunities within its historical context as a 'young discipline,' comparing its developmental trajectory to other fields like medicine and business. He emphasizes understanding sport phenomena (e.g., health outcomes, socialization) not in isolation, but in relation to their specific implementation contexts and broader societal/economic sectors. The socio-historical context of 'popular wisdom' is also critical to his argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                      | 3.  **Reflexivity**: The lecture is a highly reflexive act. Chalip positions himself and his fellow scholars ('we,' 'us') as active agents in defining the field. He urges introspection about the field's purpose, its relationship with 'home disciplines' and practitioners, and the impact of its research. By questioning current practices and calling for new research directions, he encourages the field to critically examine its own assumptions and its role in both perpetuating and challenging existing meanings of sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Sue Inglis           | Sue Inglis conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, socially constructed field that evolves through critical reflection on its 'creative tensions' and engagement in meaningful 'conversations' or 'dialogue.' Her analysis is deeply rooted in interpretivist principles. She emphasizes subjective meaning-making by exploring how individuals (academics, students, practitioners) and the collective (NASSM) interpret and navigate their roles, challenges (like work-life balance, balancing academic mandates), and the very identity of the field. Her call to reframe tensions as productive and to prefer dialogue over discussion underscores a belief in the power of interpretation and collaborative inquiry to foster growth. Contextual understanding is central, as she situates sport management within its historical development (Zeigler's legacy, NASSM's growth), its institutional setting (university mandates), its interdisciplinary connections, and its relationship to broader societal issues, arguing for relevance and engagement. Reflexivity is evident throughout as she positions herself within the discourse ('I believe,' personal anecdotes), acknowledges her influences, and invites her audience (fellow NASSM members) into a shared process of critical self-examination and future-shaping for the field. Her lecture itself is an act of interpretivist inquiry, seeking to uncover and shape understandings of sport management through dialogue and reflection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Daniel F. Mahony     | Daniel F. Mahony conceptualizes sport management as a socially constructed, dynamic field whose future depends on the collective meaning-making and concerted actions of its members. His lecture is deeply rooted in subjective meaning-making, interpreting challenges like faculty shortages and research gaps through his extensive personal and administrative experiences. He demonstrates a strong contextual understanding by consistently situating sport management's issues within broader academic, institutional, and inter-organizational power structures. Mahony's reflexivity is evident as he positions himself as both a product and advocate of collaboration, critically examines the field's internal practices, and reflects on his own scholarly journey. The central 'symphony' metaphor powerfully conveys his interpretivist vision: sport management's 'merit' and progress are not objective states but are achieved through ongoing, collaborative 'performance,' requiring dialogue, shared understanding, and unified effort to navigate its complex context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|                      | **Subjective Meaning-Making** is central as she deliberately chooses to 'suck all the pleasure and fun from the spectacle' by focusing on marginalized perspectives and negative externalities like labor exploitation and environmental damage, thereby constructing an alternative, critical meaning of sport globalization. Her interpretation of phenomena like athlete migration as 'poaching' imbues these processes with ethical weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

She positions herself not as a neutral observer but as an engaged scholar seeking to influence the field's discourse and ethical responsibilities, embodying the interpretivist value of the researcher's active role in knowledge construction and social change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Mary A. Hums         | Dr. Hums conceptualizes sport management through a deeply interpretivist lens. Her lecture is a narrative of subjective meaning-making, evident in her personal journey marking the evolution of her teaching and understanding, and her critical emphasis on the 'conscience' of sport. Her understanding is profoundly shaped by contextual understanding – historical (tracing her career over 30 years and referencing the field's foundations), social (addressing emergent global issues like human rights, environmentalism, and sport for development), and disciplinary (situating her work within and as a call to sport management educators). Reflexivity is central, as she explicitly positions herself as 'one teacher,' reflects on her changing role relative to students, acknowledges her collaborations, and underscores her responsibility (and that of her colleagues) in shaping the field's values and future practitioners. She constructs sport management not as a static set of positivistic principles but as a dynamic interplay between 'commerce' and 'conscience,' constantly being reinterpreted in light of new global realities and ethical imperatives. Her call to embed these broader issues into curricula is an appeal for a more holistic, critically reflective, and ethically engaged interpretation of the field itself, highlighting the social construction of its meaning and purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Her analysis is deeply interpretivist:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Her lecture is an act of influencing the field’s self-understanding and future direction, urging both individual and collective introspection and action. She ultimately advocates for a more nuanced, culturally aware, and globally engaged sport management scholarship and practice, co-constructed through dialogue and shared experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| David Shilbury       | David Shilbury, in his 2011 Zeigler Lecture, conceptualizes sport management as a field fundamentally defined by 'competition,' using this as a lens to critique and advocate for the centrality of 'strategy' research. His subjective meaning-making is evident in the 'heart and soul' metaphor for competition and his impassioned argument for elevating strategy research from its 'sparse' state. He demonstrates a strong contextual understanding by tracing the historical development of strategy literature, analyzing the inter-organizational dynamics of academic bodies (NASSM, SMAANZ, etc.) through the concept of 'co-opetition,' and arguing that the field's uniqueness is best revealed through contextual application of theory. Reflexively, Shilbury positions himself as an engaged scholar whose international perspective (Australian involved in North American academia) and leadership experiences inform his critique. He constructs sport management not as a static entity but as an evolving discourse, where the meanings of its core concepts and its overall identity are actively shaped by the scholarly community's choices and interpretations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Alison Doherty       | Alison Doherty conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic field at a crucial stage of development, arguing that its future vitality and relevance depend on embracing interdisciplinary research. This argument is deeply rooted in her subjective meaning-making, particularly her 'village' philosophy which equates collaborative, integrated effort with enriched understanding and personal/professional fulfillment. Her analysis demonstrates a strong contextual understanding of sport management's history, its current disciplinary 'silos,' the complexities of real-world problems, and broader academic trends. Reflexivity is central to her lecture, as she consciously positions herself as an experienced scholar using the prestigious platform to advocate for a paradigm shift, aiming to influence the collective interpretation of research excellence and practice within her field. She constructs interdisciplinarity not merely as a methodology, but as a more profound, relational, and ultimately more meaningful way of knowing and addressing the multifaceted phenomena within sport management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| George B. Cunningham | George B. Cunningham conceptualizes sport management as a social and ethical field with a profound responsibility for fostering inclusivity and justice. He employs interpretivist principles by emphasizing subjective meaning-making, urging academics to re-interpret their roles and the purpose of sport itself towards social good. His analysis is deeply rooted in contextual understanding, drawing connections between individual actions, broader social systems of inequality (historical and contemporary), and the specific academic context of sport management. He demonstrates high reflexivity by positioning himself as an engaged scholar, acknowledging his own learning journey, explicitly addressing his academic audience about their power and responsibility, and anticipating/refuting counter-narratives. For Cunningham, sport management is not a fixed set of practices but a dynamic field whose meaning and impact are continually constructed through the collective actions (or inactions) of its constituents, particularly those in academia. He argues for a conscious, collective re-construction of the field around the principles of interdependence, mutuality, and proactive social change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| James Jianhui Zhang  | Dr. Zhang conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, evolving discipline at a critical juncture, striving for greater distinctiveness and academic legitimacy. His lecture is a profound exercise in interpretivist scholarship. He engages in **subjective meaning-making** by passionately arguing for a particular vision of the field—one grounded in tangible, context-specific research that bridges theory and practice, using the Dual Process Theory as a framework to articulate this vision. His analysis is rich in **contextual understanding**, as he situates his arguments within the historical development of sport management, the ongoing dialogue initiated by previous Zeigler lecturers, and the pressing institutional challenges faced by academic programs, particularly in research universities. Furthermore, Zhang exhibits significant **reflexivity**, explicitly positioning himself, his research, and his cultural background ('as an Asian') within the narrative. He acknowledges the limitations of his perspective ('ideas are subject to debate'), his personal experiences with grant funding, and his indebtedness to mentors, all while consciously aiming to 'reenergize the discussions' and shape the future of the discipline. His call for 'conscious thought' in defining 'what to study' is itself an interpretivist act of constructing meaning and advocating for a self-aware, contextually sensitive approach to knowledge creation in sport management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Janet S. Fink        | Janet S. Fink conceptualizes sport management as a field deeply enmeshed in, and reflective of, broader societal power structures, particularly concerning gender. Her analysis is profoundly interpretivist: 1) **Subjective Meaning-Making**: She leverages her personal experiences and passion for sport ('reluctant critic') to interpret sexism not as an objective fact but as a lived, felt phenomenon 'hiding in plain sight,' whose meaning is constructed through social interaction and often normalized. 2) **Contextual Understanding**: She meticulously details how sexism in sport is historically and socially situated, often more overt ('Mad Men episode feel') than in other industries, and perpetuated by 'taken-for-granted' organizational practices and discourses. She recognizes sport as a powerful, ubiquitous platform with a unique cultural fabric. 3) **Reflexivity**: Fink explicitly positions herself within the NASSM community, acknowledging her own perspective and calling on her peers to recognize their collective agency in 'undoing gender.' She is aware of her audience and the 'risky' nature of her topic, adapting her language to engage them. Her call to adopt alternative frames (Shaw & Frisby) is a call to re-negotiate shared meanings and practices within the field. Fink ultimately portrays sport management not as a field governed by immutable laws, but as a dynamic social world where meanings are contested and where critical, reflexive scholarship can contribute to transformative change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Jeffrey D. James     | Dr. James conceptualizes sport management doctoral education as a system whose varied and often superficial approaches to scholarly training, particularly the neglect of philosophical inquiry, risk producing technicians rather than critical thinkers, thereby undermining the field's potential. His **subjective meaning-making** is evident in his interpretation of quantitative program data as symptomatic of deeper qualitative issues in pedagogical philosophy. He constructs a narrative where the 'how-to' of research has overshadowed the crucial 'why,' a meaning derived from his own values regarding rigorous scholarship. His **contextual understanding** is rooted in his decades of academic experience, his specific work at Florida State, his review of NASSM's institutional practices, and his engagement with previous Zeigler lectures, all of which inform his assessment of the field's current state and historical patterns. **Reflexivity** permeates his lecture: he interrogates his own selection for the award, uses his institutional experience as a case study, and explicitly positions himself and his peers as responsible agents for change. His call for challenging students to 'be more than we are' is a profound reflexive statement on the continuous, intergenerational project of advancing sport management as a thoughtful and impactful field of study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Daniel C. Funk       | Daniel C. Funk conceptualizes sport management scholarship as a dynamic social ecosystem where the creation and dissemination of knowledge ('idea diffusion') is a fundamentally human, often 'uncomfortably slow,' and context-dependent process. His analysis is deeply rooted in subjective meaning-making, where he interprets statistical data (citations, editorial board demographics) and personal experiences (his career path, development of the PCM, co-author network) through the theoretical lens of diffusion. He demonstrates strong contextual understanding by situating his arguments within historical debates in sport management (e.g., theory development) and the practical realities of academic publishing. Reflexivity is a cornerstone of his lecture, as he consistently positions himself as an experienced scholar using his own journey as a case study and a source of wisdom to mentor 'new and emerging scholars.' He doesn't claim to offer absolute truths but rather 'insight' and strategies derived from his interpreted reality, emphasizing the agency scholars have in navigating and shaping this ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Jennifer E. McGarry  | Jennifer McGarry conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, socially constructed field where meaning, particularly around 'scholarly impact,' is contested and shaped by power relations, historical context, and diverse subjectivities. She employs a critical interpretivist framework, asserting that knowledge is not value-neutral but deeply influenced by one's standpoint and positionality (subjective meaning-making). Her analysis of NASSM and the broader field emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific social, historical, and cultural contexts that produce inequities and narrow definitions of success (contextual understanding). Throughout the lecture, McGarry is highly reflexive, acknowledging her own 'vantage point,' critiquing dominant norms from that perspective, and calling on her peers to also engage in self-reflection and transformative action. She sees the Zeigler address itself as an opportunity to construct and negotiate new meanings, urging the field to 'Enact, Discard, Transform' outdated paradigms in favor of a more inclusive, just, and genuinely impactful future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Marlene A. Dixon     | Marlene Dixon conceptualizes sport management not as a static body of objective facts, but as a dynamic, socially constructed field, experienced and shaped by individuals on a personal journey. Her lecture is a profound exercise in interpretivism. She champions subjective meaning-making by centering personal values, authenticity, and individual passion ('study things that are important to us'), using her own career narrative as the primary vehicle for conveying insights. Her contextual understanding is evident as her interpretations (e.g., of work-life balance) are shown to be deeply embedded in and evolving through her long-term immersion in NASSM, familial roles, mentor-mentee relationships, and international experiences. Highly reflexive, Dixon acknowledges her own positionality, vulnerabilities, and the influence of others, positioning herself as a fellow traveler sharing subjectively derived wisdom. Her entire address constructs and shares meaning through storytelling and metaphor, urging her audience to find their own authentic paths within the shared academic context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Larena Hoeber        | Dr. Hoeber conceptualizes sport management's engagement with qualitative research as a dynamic and deeply personal journey of meaning-making, rather than the application of fixed rules. Through extensive reflexivity, she deconstructs her own scholarly evolution, highlighting how subjective understandings are shaped by, and in turn reshape, disciplinary contexts. She champions a continuous process of learning, questioning, and re-interpretation, urging the field to embrace the messiness and situatedness of qualitative inquiry. Her lecture is an embodiment of interpretivism, demonstrating how knowledge is constructed, contested, and contextually understood through individual and collective reflective practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Marijke Taks         | Marijke Taks conceptualizes sport management scholarship as a deeply personal, evolving, and contextually embedded journey of meaning-making. Her lecture is a powerful demonstration of interpretivism, framing knowledge not as a collection of objective, immutable truths, but as a dynamic tapestry woven from subjective experiences ('I'), significant social interactions ('influencers'), and critical responses to contextual 'triggers.' Her subjective meaning-making is evident in the overarching narrative structure she imposes on her 40-year career, particularly her framework of 'triggers, influencers, and lessons learned.' Contextual understanding is central, as pivotal moments like her transatlantic move, specific conference encounters, or engagement with differing research methodologies (e.g., 'wording matters') profoundly reshape her research questions, interpretations, and perspectives on the field's priorities. Reflexivity permeates her entire account: she continuously positions herself within her story, meticulously acknowledging the influence of others on her intellectual path and, reciprocally, articulating her intent to inspire and guide future scholars. Her research trajectory itself—moving from broad economic impacts to nuanced considerations of resident perspectives, social impacts, subjective well-being, and the complexities of leveraging—underscores a commitment to uncovering and validating subjective experiences within sport management phenomena. Ultimately, Taks portrays sport management scholarship as a field where progress is driven by relentless curiosity, robust collaboration, critical self-reflection on one's own assumptions and methods, and an ongoing, interpretive dialogue with the ever-evolving socio-economic, cultural, and academic environment. |
| Daniel S. Mason      | Daniel S. Mason conceptualizes sport management as a dynamic, socially constructed field where the development and diffusion of theory are profoundly shaped by subjective meaning-making processes, rich contextual influences (disciplinary, social, historical), and the critical reflexivity of its scholars. He portrays theory not as a set of objective truths but as tools interpreted and wielded by individuals within a community, subject to social 'necessities' that accelerate adoption and 'brakes' (including systemic inequities and gatekeeping) that suppress radical potential. His lecture is an exemplar of interpretivist inquiry itself, using personal narrative, analogy, and critical reflection to construct a nuanced understanding of the field's past, present, and potential future, ultimately advocating for a more inclusive and critically aware scholarly practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Damon Andrew         | Damon Andrew conceptualizes sport management as an evolving academic discipline facing a critical need to solidify its legitimacy and professional standing within the competitive higher education landscape. His subjective meaning-making is profoundly shaped by his role as a Dean, leading him to prioritize external validation, data-driven accountability, and standardized quality assurance (like accreditation) as markers of a 'serious' and sustainable academic program. His contextual understanding is evident in his historical overview of the field, comparisons with other disciplines (e.g., business, nursing), and analysis of stakeholder expectations within the university ecosystem. Reflexively, Andrew positions himself as a concerned insider with an administrator's pragmatic gaze, using his personal journey and experiences to underscore his arguments. He constructs a narrative of a field with potential but hampered by internal inconsistencies ('weakest links') and a collective reluctance to embrace rigorous external validation, ultimately arguing that the field's future strength depends on a shared commitment to higher standards, primarily through accreditation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
